  "text": "What a wonderful space in a beautiful & quiet neighborhood. We had an entire floor to ourselves, which felt like our own little apartment. The neighborhood is perfect - close to parks, and just a short bike ride to cafes and shops. Sasha and David were warm, friendly hosts, that spoiled us with coffee & treats each morning. Looking forward to the next visit! x",
