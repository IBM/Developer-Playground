  "text": "When I saw the posting and how clean and simple the room was, I was expecting a little less. When the wife and I got there, first off, the hosts were so genuine and accommodating, we immediately \"felt at home.\" They were so concerned about making sure they were there to greet us, and that we had accurate directions, etc. \r\n\r\nThey take us upstairs. The picture that shows the room does not justify it. This room was huge! There are windows on one side that look over trees and greenery. Walk in closet. The bed is extremely comfortable. And then there's the bathroom. My wife looked at me and asked why her bathroom didn't look like this. I wish I had taken a picture.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the house is also very beautiful. The kitchen is immaculate, a chef's dream. The house is centrally located in Austin, so you can get to any section of Austin pretty quick. It's in a beautiful area, not too far from University of Texas, Austin. It's only 15 minutes from the airport.\r\n\r\nSeriously, for the price, this was so much better than any hotel. My wife and I, when we return to Austin, would love to stay here again.",
