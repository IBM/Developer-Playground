  "text": "This is one of the first times we've been hesitant to write a review because we've been afraid of letting the secret out. :) We come to Austin fairly regularly, and we hope that this place is available for our next stay too! \r\nThe room is quite large and luxurious. The desk and large chair came in handy for my work and my wife's studying. I don't think the pictures do it justice. The view from the expansive windows is great. You feel like you're in the trees. The windows are _very_ good sound insulators, so we slept soundly each night. The bathroom is large and beautiful, and the shower is great. \r\nDownstairs, we had use of the extensive, well stocked kitchen and dining room. It's worth mentioning that their coffee machine makes some of the best coffee I've ever had. \r\nThe house is extremely well located in one of the best neighborhoods in Austin. I don't think we ever needed more than 10 minutes to get just about anywhere we needed to go, whether it was downtown, north, or south. \r\nSasha and David are kind, friendly, and understanding people. We felt right at home from the moment we came in. They love cats, which was great for us, as we do too. The cats will come keep you company if you want, but are happy to leave you to your own devices if you'd prefer. So, there's no need to be a cat person to stay here - they're just an optional bonus. :) \r\n\r\nWe wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!",
