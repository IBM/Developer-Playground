  "text": "Alexandra is an angel and this room and bathroom is heavenly. Alexandra patiently communicated with me before the trip even though my plans changed a couple times as far as arrival time and number of guests but she was endlessly helpful. The room is right inside the front door and up the stairs making the space very private. The whole house is lovely and has an incredible view including from the room. Alexandra provides everything you will need in the room from towels to toiletries and coffee and tea. There's even a small fridge on the room. Everything is completely up to date even with an amazing shower that you will never find in a hotel. The space is also an easy drive to downtown. I wonder if I will ever find another listing like this one for this reasonable price. My friends loved it and Alexandra made sure we were all comfortable. When I return to Austin, this is where I'm staying. Thank you Alexandra!",
