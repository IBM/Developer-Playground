  "text": "Awesome! That just about sums up our stay with Sasha & David!  Unfortunately, we never got to meet David, but Sasha could not have been more welcoming!  We were celebrating our 45th anniversary, and we were presented with a bottle of champagne! What a nice touch!\r\nThe room was simply amazing! The view was wonderful! The shower was fantastic!  The bed was so comfortable!  And, an added bonus was watching a half dozen or more raccoons,, plus a skunk (!), eating after dark on the property!  The house itself is in a wonderful part of Austin!  So hilly and beautiful!  \r\nWe would definitely return for another stay!  You can't go wrong with this fabulous airbnb location!",
