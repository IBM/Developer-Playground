  "text": "Alexandra and her husband were so kind. Their home is fantastic! The floor we stayed on was private, clean and very relaxing. It was difficult to leave the room at times with the large open windows looking out to a gorgeous view. It was so peaceful, we wanted to stay in all weekend!\r\n\r\nWe were in town for Valentine's Day and a race. Alexandra set out chocolates and flowers for us. Very sweet!\r\n\r\nThank you for having us in your lovely home. All the best from us both!",
