  "text": "This was my first Airbnb experience, and it surely exceeded all my expectations.  My hosts were exceptionally gracious and the second floor space was quiet, private, immaculate, and provided a spectacular view of the Shoal Creek parkway right from bed.  If you are a dog lover, as I am, take a walk south on the Shoal Creek Trail and you will run into a dog park.  There were plenty of friendly dogs to interact with.  It is also short walking distance to some delicious food venues â€“ the fish tacos at Cabo Bobs were quite tasty.",
