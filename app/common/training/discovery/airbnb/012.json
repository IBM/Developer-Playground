  "text": "Alexandra welcomed us into her home and gave us a short, yet informative, tour of the area in which we would be staying. The beautifully appointed room (excellent natural light from huge windows!) was complete with coffee and tea, bottled water, and plush towels. \r\n\r\nThe beautiful neighborhood is north of downtown Austin, but a quick walk (~30 min) along Shoal Creek path gets you right into the heart of downtown. It was very convenient to not have a car and stay here. There are plenty of neighborhood places that Alexandra made sure to recommend that we could easily walk to for food and drinks.\r\n\r\nThe photos and description that Alexandra provides are incredibly accurate. You will love staying in her stylish and comfortable room! It felt like we had our own place to stay; not that we were guests in someone's home.",
