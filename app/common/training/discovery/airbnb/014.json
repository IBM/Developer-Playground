  "text": "Let me start by saying that this was my first experience with airbnb and it was AWESOME!  Alexandria (and her husband) were outstanding host and the the room was outstanding as well. Its the little details in life that really make a difference and my stay could not have been more pleasing. A particular bonus was the near immediate response I received back when reserving the space and their willingness to accommodate me on such short notice (only a couple hours). Would definitely recommend to others who are looking for something up-scale  and will return back next time in Austin.",
