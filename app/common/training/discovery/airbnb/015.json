  "text": "My mom and I both loved our stay with Alexandra. The room is spacious and both the queen bed and twin bed on the floor were comfortable. Loved the walk in closet with mini fridge, wall of windows and huge bathroom. Definitely make sure to take a walk around the neighborhood if you have the time. Alexandra mad checking in and out a breeze and have us a great tour of our accommodations upon arrival. As this was my mom's first airbnb experience, she was pleasantly surprised. She enjoyed the netflix access on the TV in the room. This was a great last minute booking.  Uber ride to downtown was about $9 from here.",
