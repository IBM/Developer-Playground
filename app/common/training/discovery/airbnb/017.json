  "text": "Graham and I used this spot as our home base as we explored Austin to potentially move there. It is centrally located, right off Lamar, near some great restaurants, UT, and downtown. The space was quiet, clean and so pretty! Our hosts were friendly and answered our questions without being intrusive or nosy. It was really appreciated as we were weighing so many decisions, timetables and such. It was a great experience for us.",
