  "text": "Alexandra & husband David made my first stay at their lovely Austin so easy, comfortable, and pleasant.  Communication and responsiveness was a breeze, without ever being intrusive.  The space is so generous, well-appointed & relaxing -- guests will find themselves gazing out the bank of eastern-facing windows to soak in the striking view.  Black-out curtains will conversely handily keep any morning sun from waking guests unnecessarily early.\n\nThe neighborhood is beautiful and handily located for easy access to UT-North Campus shopping/dining, brief drive for on/off access via Loop 1 (MoPAC), as well as Lamar and/or Guadalupe.  15 minute trips to:  downtown, Ben White (71) & Capital of Texas highways (Barton Creek area), as well as Loop 1 (MoPAC) / 183 interchange.\n\nBe aware that one must be comfortable with steps/stairs:  down to front door from street level;  up stairwell to upper level suite.  Nothing too taxing, however!\n\nSo pleased with this property and hosts, am planning to RSVP for monthly board meetings in Austin!",
