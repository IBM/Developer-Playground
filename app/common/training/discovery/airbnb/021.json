  "text": "I can't say enough about how great this room was and how wonderful our hosts, Alexandra & David, were.  The bed was beyond comfortable and all the amenities, such as fridge, tea kettle, and local Austin books and magazines, made this stay unbelievable. The bathroom was very clean and spacious, which made it easy for my fiance and I to get ready simultaneously. We loved the location, and our warm hosts guided us to numerous local restaurants and attractions. We can't wait to return!",
