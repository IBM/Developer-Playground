  "text": "We had a great stay in Alexandra's home. The room is lovely and spacious with hotel-style amenities. There were nice fluffy towels for us to use, waters and snacks in the fridge, and a great view through the large windows. The bed was also super comfortable. It's slightly out of the way from downtown, but we took an Uber there for less than $10 each way, and the neighborhood is very beautiful. We didn't interact much with Alexandra since she was out of town, but she was very responsive and nice.",
