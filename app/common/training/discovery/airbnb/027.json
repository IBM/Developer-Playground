  "text": "This was my first time using AirBnB, and we could have not asked for a better experience! First of all, Alexandra and David are such nice people who truly know how to host. Alexandra made sure we had plenty of recommendations where to go, and even called a restaurant for us to see their availability before we arrived. We were celebrating our anniversary, and in the mini fridge there was champagne for us! Along with that were chocolates, yogurt, bananas, drinks, coffee and tea. The room and bathroom were high quality, clean, and spacious. We couldn't believe how nice everything was for the price we paid. There was no negative thing about this place, but my favorite thing was how accommodating and caring they were for our dog. It was so nice to stay with people who are animal lovers like us, and our dog loved the place too. Everything was such a breeze! Definitely will stay here again when I come back to Austin.",
