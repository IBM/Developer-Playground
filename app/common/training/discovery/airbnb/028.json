  "text": "More peaceful than a hotel--and there's Netflix...  The loft was an oasis in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood convenient to all my favorite spots in Austin.  Alexandra had thought of everything, including extra toiletries if I'd forgotten anything, and snacks and water bottles in the fridge.  She even lent me a pillow so my rental car would stop hurting my back, and I almost took it to the airport with me by accident!  The only downside was that I stood outside too long one day and the mosquitoes found me--but that's south Texas for you.  The easy chair is dangerous and may lead to unplanned naps. ;)  This place will be at the top of my list for my next trip to Austin!",
