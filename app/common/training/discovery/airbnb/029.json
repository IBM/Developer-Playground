  "text": "I really enjoyed my stay in Alexandra's home. The room and bathroom are incredibly spacious. The room is bright due to the windows that face the backyard. The walk-in closet had a small fridge with yogurt, water and orange juice, which I really appreciated. The home is quiet so it's perfect if you're looking to get a good night's rest - the bed is very comfortable. The property is located in a beautiful neighborhood in Austin. Alexandra is warm, friendly, and easy going. I would definitely stay there again if I returned to Austin.",
