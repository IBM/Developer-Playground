  "text": "Alexandra was the perfect host! The room was an absolute dream. The bed is soooo comfortable! The home is very quiet, surrounded by trees, in a lovely neighborhood. Downtown Austin is a short 10 min drive away, and the house is close to many highways. Alexandra made us feel right at home from the start. She is so thoughtful and made our stay such a joy. I will definitely stay with her again when in Austin!",
