  "text": "Staying at Alexandra's place was such an amazing experience. As soon as my wife and I walked into the home we felt welcomed like family. The home is in a beautiful location that was a 10 min drive ($6-$8 Uber/Lyft) from downtown/6th street. The room is clean, large, and has a wonderful view of the greenbelt and western edge of the UT Campus. We really loved the mini-fridge, tea kettle, and delicious snacks that were left for us. The bathroom feels really luxurious and the shower is killer. The bed was very comfortable and we had our own thermostat control which was perfect with the hot weather we experienced when we were there.  Alexandra and her husband were perfect hosts because they were super approachable if we needed anything, but also gave us our privacy. 100% recommend this room and would definitely return in the future.",
