  "text": "Alexandra and David were great hosts, available if we needed anything, but otherwise left us to our privacy. The room and bath were very private and really spacious and beautiful. There was a large walk-in closet that also had a refrigerator with drinks and snacks, \r\nand a coffeemaker. I am somewhat familiar with Austin so knew the fabulous neighborhood was convenient to downtown. I was really very happy with the location, and the 2nd floor view out over the trees of the neighboring park. I would return here in a heartbeat.",
