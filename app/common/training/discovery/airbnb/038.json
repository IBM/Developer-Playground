  "text": "Alexandra and David could not have been more gracious, kind and caring. My son and I felt right at home...immediately. When Alexandra learned that I was helping my son to get moved into his new apartment and buy a used car, she provided lots of very helpful insight and information about Austin. And it turned out she, David and I have much in common, from love of travel, to cooking, wine, cats, etc. Their home is gorgeous with a great location along Shoal Creek in a very upscale neighborhood. The top floor room we stayed in was ideal. Wonderful view, great big room with a comfy bed, big easy chair, tv, closet with refrigerator, and a very spacious and modern bathroom. When my wife and I come to Austin to visit our son, I told Alexandra we will be staying at out new 'home-away-from-home'.",
