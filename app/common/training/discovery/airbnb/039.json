  "text": "Alexandra's home was incredibly clean, welcoming, and quiet.  It's situated in a very quiet and classy neighborhood, an easy Uber ride from the city center.  I felt completely safe there, especially as I was traveling alone.  She was very kind and greeted me warmly, but also allowed me my space.  The organic bananas and KIND bars were a lovely added touch!  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",
