  "text": "Linda was a welcoming and gracious host - making sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. Even beyond my own stay, she also ensured that my daughters had a good time at her home with individual beds. We all enjoyed Linda's great kitchen, too, where we prepared  and enjoyed holiday meals. Linda was very responsive in communicating ahead of my stay and made sure I could reach her at any time just in case I had any questions. Linda's screened-in back porch was cozy and the large yard and decks were also very nice. The neighborhood is only a 10-minute drive from downtown and there is convenient shopping, including Whole Foods, and many restaurants nearby. This was a very nice stay!",
