  "text": "Linda is a wonderful hostess. She enjoys meeting new people, and we had some great conversations. The setting is perfect -- very clean with lots of privacy. Don't miss her deck. She even prepared breakfast and that was an unexpected treat. I'll definitely request her as a hostess again, particularly since I go to Austin for business periodically.",
