  "text": "Ms. Linda was a great host. She was welcoming, helpful, and easy to talk to. She provided breakfast during our entire stay, which was nice. The listing description is accurate. Our room was clean and really comfortable. The bathroom was also nice with basic necessities for shower (clean towels, shampoo, soap, etc) provided for us. One of the things that we really appreciated from our stay was the neighborhood. It was quiet and safe. Overall, we had a great trip to Austin, TX and a very pleasant stay.",
