  "text": "Linda was a great host. She is an adorable lady and also very smart. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. She offered to made us breakfast in the morning and told us about good places to eat around. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and just 10 minutes from downtown Austin. I would definitely stay with her next time I visit Austin!!",
