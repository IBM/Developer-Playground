  "text": "My friend and I stayed in Kristine's flat while we were in town to see a concert. The house was adorable, smartly decorated and had everything we needed. She even had a selection of beverages in the fridge. The bathroom is especially rad. The location was walking distance from bars and restaurants. We met Kristine briefly, and she was super friendly and very welcoming. I'd love to stay again next time I'm in Austin.",
