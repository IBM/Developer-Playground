  "text": "Flew in from SF & I booked a couple nights during a week full of work meetings, dinners etc. in Austin. . . The moment I walked in to Kristine's flat I knew I was in for a treat! Kristine was easy to communicate with the entire time ( I wish I had the opportunity to meet her but I think due to our schedules we kept missing each other! ) Clean, Cozy, Warm and classy. Best n' biggest shower ever! \r\nI would love to book again next time I visit! I always rent a bike when I'm in Austin and Kristine's flat was about 2.5 miles from downtown 6th st. . . beautiful little bike ride. \r\nHighly recommend this little oasis to anyone looking for a quiet n' cozy retreat after a long day.",
