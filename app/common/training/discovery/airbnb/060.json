  "text": "The place is fantastic! Very clean and spacious. The bathroom is unreal with the biggest open shower I have ever seen! Very beautifully decorated. It was the perfect place to stay in Austin. Close to a lot of cute restarts and the East Austin night life, but in a quiet residential neighborhood so you can rest up for tomorrow's adventures. \r\nThank you Kristine for hosting us! We had a blast!",
