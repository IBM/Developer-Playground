  "text": "This place was great. I stayed here for SXSW, but I would and stay here again any time. The location is ideal and easily walkable to downtown. The flat offers great privacy and also has laundry and other amenities that will come in handy for an extended stay. There's not a bad thing I could say about the flat. Highly recommended.",
