  "text": "We had a perfect stay at Kristine's flat.  It is clean, spacious, beautifully decorated and has an extremely comfortable (and large) bed.  It was the perfect base from which to explore Austin, as we could walk to several famous food carts/restaurants in East Austin and then had easy access to the highway and downtown for driving elsewhere.  Kristine could not have been easier to communicate with and was incredibly generous and kind, allowing us to use her Pack'n'Play for our 6 month old while we were there and then even letting us borrow it for a few more days as we traveled outside Austin.  She also helped coordinate babysitting for us!  Kristine and her family were always welcoming and friendly when we saw them, though our space still felt very private and completely our own.  We simply could not have had a better stay and would stay there again in a second.",
