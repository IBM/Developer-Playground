  "text": "Kristine's place was amazing!  There was plenty of room, comfortable bed, clean, and hands down the best shower in the world.  The location is in a great part of town in what I would describe as authentic Austin.  Just a few blocks to great bistros, restaurants, bars, and B-cycles.  B-cycles are the best way to zip around Austin.  Kristine was a great host and was very accommodating in our stay.  I would absolutely recommend Kristine's granny flat.",
