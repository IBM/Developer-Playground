  "text": "My Modern Granny Flat stay was great. Very close to downtown, with a bus that runs often and with the yellowcab app, taking taxis was a breeze. The place is lovely and like others have mentioned the shower is fantastic! Kristine was super responsive too! It's my first airbnb experience so I hope they are all this good.",
