  "text": "Kristine's Modern Granny Flat is even better than it looks in the pictures. It's in a quiet neighborhood about two minutes from the highway. It's perfect for anyone who wants to stay about five minutes from downtown Austin, but not have to pay the exorbitant rates to stay there. Kristine and her family live in a house attached to the flat. They were very friendly and always around, but did not intrude in our business. All in all, an excellent airbnb choice.",
