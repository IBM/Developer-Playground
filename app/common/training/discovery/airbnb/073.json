  "text": "A serene and delightful experience.  Kristine's granny flat is beautiful, comfortable, convenient and quiet.  I would stay again any time.  You have to see and experience the shower, wow!  A giant walk in wrapped in sea colored tiles, I want one.  The property is so close to everything but the street is quiet and dark, very good for sleeping.  The bed is big and so soft and decadent with pillows and a comforter.  The couch is the perfect place to curl up and watch some tv late at night. Kristine was the perfect host, helpful and friendly.  Thank you so much!",
