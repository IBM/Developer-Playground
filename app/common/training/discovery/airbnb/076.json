  "text": "We never saw Kristine or anyone else during the one-night stay that we had, which we didn't mind because we were looking for a quiet, relaxing stay.  Kristine was quick to answer our pre-trip questions and she was very helpful.  The shower and bathroom really are spectacular as others have noted.  The neighborhood is eclectic as you would expect in East Austin.  There are some very nice homes and also some run-down homes.  In the morning I walked a few blocks to the Hillside Farmacy for breakfast and it was delightful.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the pictures were slightly misleading in that they didn't show that the kitchenette is not connect to the rest of the flat.  It is separated by a breezeway which is only slightly inconvenient if you plan on bringing or making food at the place. Overall, we were happy with our stay.",
