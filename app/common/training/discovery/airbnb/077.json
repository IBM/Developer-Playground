  "text": "Kristine's flat was perfect. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, the place was clean and quiet and beautifully done.  The bathroom was a huge selling point, as was the comfortable king size bed and high end bedding.  Kristine made herself available in case we needed advice on where to go, and was very accommodating and sweet. I would definitely stay here again next time I visit.",
