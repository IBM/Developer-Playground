  "text": "Really enjoyed staying at the modern granny flat.  Its exactly as it appears in the pictures, and the shower WAS really impressive!  Location is good - lots of fun stuff in East Austin withing walking distance, plus Austin B Cycle station not too far away, and always plenty of Car2Gos around.  Very quiet place, and accomodating hosts.  Note to future guests - Micklethwait Meats is not too far from here and has WAY shorter lines than Franklin BBQ.  Just sayin'...",
