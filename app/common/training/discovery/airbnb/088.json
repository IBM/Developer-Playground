  "text": "Kristine was wonderful. We didn't actually get to meet in person, but she was nice and responded to all my questions right away! The house was wonderful - clean and unique. It looked just like the pictures and even better. I liked the location a lot because the area is quiet and access to the city and campus are easy as well. Overall, I was so glad to stay at Kristine's and I would recommend it to anyone!",
