  "text": "We had a great stay at the Modern Granny Flat. The place was very clean and a short drive from all Austin has to offer. We had trouble accessing wifi at the start of the trip, but Kristine was quick to resolve the issue! I wouldn't recommend this place if you are wanting to use a kitchen for meal prep, but we simply used the fridge which worked perfect for us. Overall, a great little place!",
