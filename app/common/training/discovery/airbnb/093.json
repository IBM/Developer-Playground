  "text": "We had a great trip. The studio was the perfect place to come back to after long days and nights with friends who live in town. The place was clean and set up well. Kristine made it very easy to check in and even gave some great recommendations for restaurants. We tried Bufalina. It was delicious and right up our alley. We will keep this on our list of places to stay when we are back in town.",
