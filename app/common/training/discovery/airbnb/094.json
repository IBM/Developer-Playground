  "text": "Kristine have us very clear instructions of how to find her home which were really useful as we'd never visited the area before. The flat was exactly what we needed, close to town and quiet. The facilities were great - the bed was great for a perfect night sleep and the shower was amazing! I would stay there again if I visited Austin!",
