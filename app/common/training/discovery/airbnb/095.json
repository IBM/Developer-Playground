  "text": "Great place that was just as advertised. Centrally located -- just a short drive or about 20 min walk from east 6th and close to downtown as well. If you're not going to walk, I recommend using uber to get around especially if you're heading to east 6th bc there is very limited parking in that area. Definitely recommend!",
