  "text": "We loved the Modern Granny Flat! It is 100% true to the pictures, and the perfect amount of space for one or two people. The bed was so comfortable, and the shower was amazing (and huge!).\r\n\r\nWe didn't use the kitchen at all, but it looked perfectly nice. There were too many delicious restaurants to try in Austin! We'd highly recommend Tamale House East and Cenote for breakfast or lunch - they're both within a 5-minute drive, also in East Austin (such a cool developing neighborhood, and much more low-key than downtown).\r\n\r\nWe had a car, but you can also easily take Uber anywhere around Austin. \r\n\r\nWe didn't have a chance to meet Kristine, but she was very accommodating and easy to get in touch with. We'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable alternative to a hotel.",
