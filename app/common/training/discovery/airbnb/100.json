  "text": "We had a great stay in Kristine's flat this past weekend! She was a very gracious host. It was very clean, perfect for two guests, and had all the necessities for a comfortable stay. A big plus is that the flat is in a quiet neighborhood, but still a short distance from all that Austin has to offer. The East Austin area is very close and has a lot to offer. Would definitely recommend this flat to anyone looking to stay in the area.",
