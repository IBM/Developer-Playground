  "text": "Our trip to Austin was everything we hoped it would be, and staying in Kristine's flat was perfect. We had easy access to downtown and the airport. The flat was very clean and comfortable. The shower is even more amazing than the pictures show, and the bed was cozy. We are usually very picky and slept well for the four nights we were here. The next time we come to Austin we will definitely be trying to book here again. This was our first time using Airbnb, and thanks to Kristine it definitely will not be our last.",
