  "text": "We had a great experience in Austin, and it truly did start with settling in to this flat, regroup, and recharge when needed. Flat is separate from the rest of the home, but brand new and updated with Austin flavor. The Shower was unbelievable, and plenty big! Very clean, comfortable, and all the amenities we needed for a long weekend in Austin. Great location too, walking distance to East 6th st. and a short $5 Uber ride to downtown.",
