  "text": "The flat was in a great location-close, but not too close to downtown. Very accessible and had everything we needed. \n\nThe shower was lovely but be warned there is no door. And we had an unfortunate cold and rainy weekend so the place was a bit cold, but the heating unit did its job. I can imagine in hot Texas weather the cement flooring is heaven. \n\nBed was super comfortable too! The wifi never worked while we were there. Kristine was super responsive but we never got it to work. Not a huge deal but just a heads up in case you are relying on it.",
