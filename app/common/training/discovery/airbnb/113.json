  "text": "This flat looks exactly as it does in the photos and the shower really is huge! It's a lovely, homey and private place to stay in the heart of Austin. (You can reach just about any restaurant or tourist site with a $3 Uber ride.) Kristine and her family and kitties were very friendly and checking in was a breeze. Kristine even lets you park in her driveway, which is a huge bonus considering how hard it is to park everywhere in the city. Highly recommended! I would definitely stay here again.",
