  "text": "Kristine made check-in and check-out painless and efficient. The flat is lovely, with fresh air, good climate control, comfortable furniture, and a huge bathroom where a small car could shower with you; a very clean and welcoming space, true to its listing. The neighborhood is quiet, walkable, and well-maintained. I highly recommend Kristine's flat for a simple, affordable, clean, and comfortable space.",
