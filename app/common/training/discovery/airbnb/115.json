  "text": "The flat was exactly as pictured. Shower and bed are just as amazing as they look. I didn't realize that the kitchen and washer/dryer were a separate entrance from the bedroom but that may have been oversight on my part. We walked almost everywhere from the flat but Ubers were readily available for when we needed to be somewhere quickly. Would definitely come back.",
