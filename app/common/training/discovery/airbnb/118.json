  "text": "This is just a beautiful, peaceful, well located house. Would definitely recommend. My first time in Austin, really glad I chose this place. The shower is amazing, the bed super comfortable. I recommend going for a run in the area to get a feeling of the houses here. Really cool/hipsterish :)",
