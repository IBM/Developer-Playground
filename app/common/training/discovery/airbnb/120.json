  "text": "Kristine and her husband were wonderful and very accommodating. The flat was as described and the location wasn't too far outside town.  I came here for SXSW and would have loved to be a little closer to town, but it was nice to have a space with a kitchen of my own. If you are planning on cooking however, just let Kristine know and she will ensure she has everything you need!",
