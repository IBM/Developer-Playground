  "text": "Kristine was a perfect host! We never saw her, but we knew she was available if needed. The flat was exactly as described, comfortable and cozy. The decor and color scheme were serene and soothing, no detail was overlooked in making the space welcoming. We did not take advantage of the kitchen or laundry facilities, but they are literally three steps across a breezeway. The neighborhood is a great location, walking distance or a short cab ride to 6th street and Rainey. I highly recommend, and hope to return in the future.",
