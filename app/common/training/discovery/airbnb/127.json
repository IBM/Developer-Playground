  "text": "1) Location is perfect. Close enough where we could walk to some really good food trucks, but far enough where we felt like we were in our own little part of town. Most Uber rides we took were around 5 bucks. Lovely.\r\n\r\n2) The pictures are accurate -- it's very, very well designed space. Oh, and the shower is incredible, I could spent hours in that thing.\r\n\r\n3) Didn't get to meet Kristine, but she was very responsive via text messaging. Highly recommend.",
