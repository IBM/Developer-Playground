  "text": "This was the perfect place to stay. We live in Austin but utilized this space during our wedding weekend, since lots of friends and family were staying at our own house + we needed a good spot for the bridal party to get ready in. On the first night, we had friends come over after rehearsal dinner and it was so fun to host them in this cozy guest cottage - and then to say bye so my now-husband and I could enjoy a peaceful evening. It's in a great location that was easy for everyone to get to. On wedding day our hair and makeup people set up shop and it was a beautiful and relaxing location for our getting ready. The little girl staying in the main house entertained my niece Scout - it was adorable to watch them play. The host's mother was actually on-premise during our stay and she was fantastic, very warm and accommodating. After our wedding it was a great place to decompress before we set off for our honeymoon the next morning. I am so thankful to Kristine for the beautiful ambiance she has created in this Airbnb. It kept us sane and was our serene little headquarters amidst a lot of craziness. THANK YOU!",
