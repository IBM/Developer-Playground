  "text": "Had a great time at the Granny Flat! Kristine was the bomb! She was reachable at a moments notice and even allowed us to drop our bags off to explore the area since we arrived earlier than check in. The flat itself was very clean and well kept! Perfect spot to hang out and relax after a day out on the town.",
