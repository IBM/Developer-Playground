  "text": "An unexpected flight delay led my girlfriend and I to Kristine's apartment for a night, and we only wish we'd found it earlier. The location is great, and the apartment was very clean, beautiful, minimally-designed, comfortable, and had an amazing shower. We were there for such a short period of time, we didn't get a chance to meet Kristine but the communication was just fine. We would definitely return. Thanks!",
