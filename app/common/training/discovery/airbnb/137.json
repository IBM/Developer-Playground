  "text": "Kristine's Granny Flat was the perfect Austin getaway! I was only in town for one night to attend a concert and Kristine was wonderfully accommodating. She was extremely flexible with check in/out times, and very polite when we met briefly. The neighborhood is quiet, tranquil and very easy to get to via car or public transit. The apt itself is magic! It looks exactly as pictured (yes the shower is that amazing) and the space felt very comfortable and homey. I cannot recommend this space highly enough. I would not hesitate to book this spot again if my travels place me back in Austin.",
