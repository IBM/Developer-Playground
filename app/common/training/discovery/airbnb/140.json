  "text": "Kristine was very attentive and the place was beautiful. Probably the best shower I've ever seen in an AirBnB and amazingly comfortable bed. Was a good base for seeing Austin with some nice areas nearby within walking distance (possibly not at night), but otherwise an easy Uber/slightly longer walk into other areas of Austin. Thanks for a great time!",
