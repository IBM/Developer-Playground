  "text": "Very stylish and modern flat, really comfy bed and very nice shower. Was so easy with communication with Kristine to organize everything. Fairly good location still had to get mostly ubers everywhere as too hot to walk 30 minutes into town but this was fine as uber is cheap and easy! Had a great stay",
