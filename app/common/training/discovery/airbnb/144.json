  "text": "Very cute AirBnB in a really central location. The bathroom/shower is even better looking in real life. The kitchen/washer/dryer area is not connected to the bedroom. It's right outside the bed/bath door on the other side of a little breezeway. Just FYI. We had a really easy time getting to cool restaurants/bars/coffee on the Eastside in under 5 minutes. The host was nice and accommodating.",
