  "text": "We LOVED our stay at the Modern Granny Flat. The space was so clean, eclectically decorated and in a great location. We could get to downtown so quick but were set away enough to relax (especially from the heat). Every review had mentioned the shower and I understand why...WOW! What I didn't realized is how big it is and it's fun not needing a wall/door or shower curtain. The bed was very comfortable, we have no complaints. We will definitely be coming back to ATX and staying here again!",
