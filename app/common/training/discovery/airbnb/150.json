  "text": "The cute flat was just as described and surprisingly spacious. As the rest of the reviewers have already stated, the shower is AMAZING! The neighborhood is quiet and well lit, the flat itself was clean and comfortable, and the a/c was ice cold (very important in the middle of Texas summer). The location was perfect - close to downtown, Rainey Street, etc.",
