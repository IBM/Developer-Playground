  "text": "The place is amazing, the neighborhood is safe and is close to a lot of great food. The pictures don't quite do it justice and the pictures for the place are awesome. When booking we told Kristine that we'd be traveling with our six month old, when we arrived a pack and play had been set up and ready to go which was a tremendously welcome sight after driving for fourteen hours. I've probably said how much I miss this place a dozen times since leaving. Would book again in a second!",
