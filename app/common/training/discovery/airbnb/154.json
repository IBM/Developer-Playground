  "text": "This flat is clearly recently constructed but was a little lacking in my opinion. The first major issue we had is the location. Given the Austin heat in the summer, this spot is not well situated to walk anywhere. If you do not have a car, I don't recommend staying here as it is a very far walk to get to the major tourist spots and bars/restaurants of Austin. Also, for the price we were disappointed with some of the details. For example, the kitchen is separate, not part of the unit, so you have to walk outside to access. Also 2 of the 7 windows had folded paper window coverings that can't be opened (because they're paper) and 3 of the windows have no window coverings at all. The window situation makes it difficult to sleep in past 7am as the room starts getting light at sunrise.",
