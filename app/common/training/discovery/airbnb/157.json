  "text": "Just as advertised...very comfortable bed, amazing shower, and great A/C (and yes we were there during the 100+ degree temps). Only there for one night so didn't take advantage of kitchen, it's right across breezeway not a big deal as I read in a few reviews. Would definitely stay again. Great location for concert at Frank Erwin Center. Uber was less than $5.00 from 6th street.",
