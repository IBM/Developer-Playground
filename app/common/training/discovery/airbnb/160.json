  "text": "The Modern Granny Flat is truly an Austin gem! We arrived in the late afternoon and got to meet Kristine's husband and darling daughter as they were on their way out. As soon as we walked in the door, we were truly blown away by how incredible the space was. You can really tell that that there was a lot of thought that went into designing the space and the layout. The flat is exactly as pictured and the shower is truly spectacular! I understand why everyone raves about it. The king bed was comfortable and nicely positioned under the AC unit. The kitchen and laundry room are separate but are connected by a covered breezeway which was very nice. We were able to cook a spaghetti dinner with garlic bread the night we got there and were able to keep our breakfast food in the clean fridge. The next morning we found that the trash from cooking the night before had already been taken out by the time we went in there for breakfast around 9:00am. The flat is in a nice quiet neighborhood that we felt very safe in. Kristine was very easy and quick with communication. She is truly a Super Host. Our expectations were blown away and we can't imagine staying anywhere else in Austin! The Modern Granny flat is one of a kind!",
