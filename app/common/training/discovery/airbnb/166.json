  "text": "We arrived in Austin after a long drive and a long final day.  No registration hassle, no waiting and no explanations of why what was promised was not available.  We were able to settle in right away to a lovely flat that fit the description.\r\n\r\nWe were indeed within walking distance of 6th Street, the State Capitol and about 10 minutes from Franklin's BBQ.  Well you can tell what filled our days and the flat was the perfect base camp.  Our evening reception included some cat time and conversations outdoors on the patio.  The apartment was a great home away from home.",
