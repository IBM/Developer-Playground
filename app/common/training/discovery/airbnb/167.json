  "text": "What an awesome place to stay!! Very well decorated with spa like accents. Perfect location off 12th street highway exit, so close to 6th street for restaurants, bars, shopping. Not to mention Franklin's BBQ is just few blocks away. Kristine was very helpful and responsive to questions. Will definitely stay again when back in Austin. My wife loved the whole experience. Thank you",
