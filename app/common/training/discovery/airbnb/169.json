  "text": "Very lovely home! Clean and LOVED the shower. Location is walking distance to Franklin Barbecue (a must try!) and a close distance to downtown. Kristine was very nice. We noticed there wasn't an iron, but I texted her and she promptly arrived with an iron and ironing board. I would definitely recommend this place! \r\n\r\nWe also loved the cat!",
