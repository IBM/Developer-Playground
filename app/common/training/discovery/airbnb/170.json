  "text": "Kristine was extremely easy to contact and offered recommendations for the area (I had a great dinner based on her suggestions). Her instructions were clear and accurate, it was very easy to get into the space. The space was exactly as pictured, very comfortable, quiet and I would definitely stay there again. She has great decor and the art would make any creative a happy camper. I may have bathroom envy for the rest of my life.",
