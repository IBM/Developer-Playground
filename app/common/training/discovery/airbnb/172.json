  "text": "The perfect ACL oasis - Bazzzzzzzzilion stars!! Patryce was the perfect host! She even mailed back my friend's pillow when he left it during our stay - that's what I call amazing service.  The comfort and service that we encountered makes this place my go to Austin home away from home.\r\n\r\nThe home is ubercute and comfy.  The well stocked bathroom with everything you need (towels, shampoo, soap, even toothbrushes and everything else you may have forgot) is a great touch.  The two comfy bedrooms gave us the room we needed and the central a/c and fans in both bedrooms, made sure the temp was a perfect 72 degrees.  The kitchen has great 50's detailing and has everything we needed for breakfast and cooking (if we wanted to).  I recommend this place to all.",
