  "text": "Patryce met us in front of the house right when we arrived from the airport. She gave us a tour, wrote down a lovely note for house instructions and local recommendations, and even had guest ready amenities for us (extra blankets, shampoo, etc). Patryce is the best host - super friendly, great communication, extremely accommodating. Now about little Hank House. I was with 2 of my girlfriends and we were doing a little girls' retreat/ reunion along with ACL. We could not have stayed in a better place. We loved the house. We rented out the whole place, so we had the 2 bedrooms to ourselves. Having the kitchen, living room, and the backyard patio was amazing. We stocked up the kitchen with snacks, lots of wine, and drank outside most nights. It was perfect for us. FYI - There's no television and internet is spotty, but this wasn't important for us.",
