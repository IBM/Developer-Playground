  "text": "Patryce was so warm and inviting, as was her \"old school-cool\" '52 home. It was clean, comfortable, and ideally located in SoCo. A buddy and I came out for the F1 race at COTA. It was a short 20-minute drive. It's a REALLY short hop to nightlife and restaurants. Wi-Fi was great and we appreciated the absence of TV. The neighborhood was quiet and the beds were comfortable. I'd certainly recommend a stay especially considering the affordable rate, easy policies, and lack of exorbitant security deposit. I just emplore anyone considering a stay here to respect the home as we tried to do so Patryce continues to make her door open for everyone to enjoy.",
