  "text": "Patryce's home was wonderful- clean, well decorated, and conveniently located. She was so accomodating and kind. I booked the home for my in-laws who were in town for our wedding. Patryce gave me a fair price (even though it was opening weekend of SXSW!) and was available while also allowing the parents their privacy. This was their first experience with Airbnb and they were a bit weary to begin, but they were happy in the home and had a lovely weekend.  Thank you, Patryce, for being a fantastic host and making our family feel welcome and comfortable!",
