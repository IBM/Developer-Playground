  "text": "I can't seem to find the trillion star button?!  If you're looking for a chill getaway in Austin and want to feel comfortable/cozy, look no further.  This 1952 South Austin home is it!  Patryce (host) is truly an affable human that really made us feel at home.  The house was quaint, equipped with all the necessities and described perfectly.  Patryce didn't freak out from the volume of guests and even bought us breakfast tacos!  Great for BBQs, family vacays, or just a place to crash in the rain.",
