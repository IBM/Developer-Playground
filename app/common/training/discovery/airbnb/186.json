  "text": "Patryce was very welcoming and accommodating!  The house is adorable , she left us cupcakes and coffee upon arrival !  She even offered her cruiser bike and pumped te tires!  10 min drive to south congress (car or bike is helpful if you want to leave the residential neighborhood).\r\n\r\npAtryce stays in a studio separate from the apartment behind the driveway, and will text (available if help needed).  Wifi and a piano too.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
