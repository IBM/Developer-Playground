  "text": "Our experience at the Zilker Hayloft was great! Our host was timely in communication (though we never actually met), and the listing was just as advertised on Airbnb. It was very clean and perfect for a homebase while my husband and I helped my best friend apartment hunt in Austin.  The bathroom doors are sliding wood doors that cover the opening to the bathroom but don't seal completely shut the way a typical door does. It wasn't really a problem, but just FYI. Also, there is only one mirror in the whole place. Heads up to parties traveling with more than one person who uses a mirror to fix their hair or makeup in the mornings.  The loft had all the utensils we needed to cook dinner and breakfast, and we enjoyed some of the board games there as well. The windows here are great, but still lots of privacy. It felt like being in a tree house! The neighborhood felt safe and it was close to lots of local attractions. Overall, another lovely experience with Airbnb.",
