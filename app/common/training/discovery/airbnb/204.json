  "text": "We stayed 3 nights at the Zilker Hayloft, a wonderful 2-bedroom home just a few miles from downtown Austin. The pictures are very representative of the home; beautiful kitchen, 2 bedrooms with king bed in one and queen in the other, large dining room, and a living room. Everything was clean and well taken care of. We did not use the outdoor space but there is a 2nd-story deck along with a tranquil backyard.  The Zilker area has many tasty restaurants within walking distance, and the Barton Hills Greenbelt is nearby ~ wonderful for a hike or bike ride.  Mary was a great host.  We look forward to future visits!",
