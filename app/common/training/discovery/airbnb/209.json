  "text": "Clean and comfy \"Hayloft\" in a great location. Two beds, plus a futon in the living room. Everything worked, from the Wifi to the tv/cable. Mary had books, toys, and dvd's to keep us entertained during rainy downtime. And we were a 5-10 minute drive from attractions like greenways, UT Austin, record shops, book stores, Whole Foods, and lots of great restaurants and food trucks. Zilker is a great neighborhood to explore--plenty of parks nearby to run to and through.",
