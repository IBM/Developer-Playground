  "text": "This was my first AirBnB stay and a great experience.  I think this place was way cuter than the pictures made it out to be.  There is a lovely porch off one bedroom and the bathroom was small but modern.  In the several nights we stayed there, we were able to spread out and find our own working spaces in way that we would not have been able to in a traditional hotel.  We were in a residential neighborhood in a  fun part of Austin. There several restaurants and food trucks within walking distance. When we were out at night, neighbors were friendly and said hello to us.  Mary was really responsive.   At one point, we wanted to know about street parking and she got back to us right away about neighborhood parking policies and we never had a problem. \r\n\r\nWe went several places in Austin and the location was great for us as home base.  It was easy to get places and had good access to major streets.",
