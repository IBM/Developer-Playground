  "text": "Zilker Loft was an amazing place to stay in Austin. There were four of us staying at this place and there was ample room for four more people. Mary was super easy to deal with and we will definitely be staying at Zilker Lofts again. \r\n\r\nIt was a fantastic location (a short walk to Shake Shack) in a really nice area, with plenty of other food and drink options!! We would thoroughly recommend it to anyone staying with a larger group in Austin!!",
