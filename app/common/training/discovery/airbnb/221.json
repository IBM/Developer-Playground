  "text": "Beata and Davvi's apartment is beautiful and lovely. The room I stayed in was very clean and bright and peaceful - perfect to get rest and sleep after a week of craziness from SXSW. Most importantly for me, it had great energy and warmth that could only come from a loving family. I was very lucky to meet their 2 year old girl Leila who told me all about her experience at the zoo that day. I'd definitely recommend their room to anyone who wants a serene stay in Austin.",
