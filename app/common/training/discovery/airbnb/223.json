  "text": "Staying at this little studio was awesome! Everything was so clean and homey. We enjoyed how close it was to a quaint coffee shop, an HEB, and several places to eat. Also just a short drive to South Congress, downtown, and Lamar! Patricia was an excellent host. She communicated so well, and was very friendly when she met us at the location to give us the key! It was a very easy-going experience and SOOO much better than staying at a hotel.",
