  "text": "Our stay for ACL was great.  The location was great to get downtown if you were driving.  The What-a-Burger next to the apartment complex was heaven after a long night out.  We would stay here again if we are ever in Austin again.  Patricia was a great host leaving some cold ones in the fridge along with some monsters and waters.  We couldn't have asked for anything else.",
