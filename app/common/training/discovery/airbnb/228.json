  "text": "The place was really cute and so clean! Very well decorated, and Patricia even provided us with coffee, breakfast bars, and beer. Very welcoming! We didn't use the pool during our stay, but it is right around the corner from the unit. The apartment is close to Buzzmill and other south Austin/Riverside attractions/transportation. Good location. The only problem was when we arrived we couldn't get a hold of her for 45 minutes while sitting in the parking lot in the rain. Other than that, great stay!",
