  "text": "Patricia was very open and welcoming when my friend and I visited Austin. Her apartment is cozy and decorated adorably and was very clean and comfortable for our stay. While her location is not downtown, she is a quick Uber (about $7) to almost anything you'd want to do in Austin. We had a great experience at her place and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing the town!",
