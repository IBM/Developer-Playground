  "text": "I had a great stay at Alicia's house. She wasn't here while I stayed, but everything was set up when I got there. The neighborhood is safe but a little bit empty for someone without a car...going to the grocery was an expedition in itself ! :) for everything else, like going downtown, there are various bus stops really close to the house. Very convenient.\r\n\r\nThe house could certainly use a deep cleaning but I was only there for a short period so it didn't bother me that much.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, everything was fine, the roommates were VERY quiet and the house is full of Alicia's creations, which gives a good feeling to the place.",
