  "text": "Fantastic setup in a great Neighborhood.  The room is actually a modern addition on an updated mid-century home. Clearly designed by architects and built by craftsmen the usable private space was the perfect base for my weekend in Austin. Bedroom was nice sized, clean and comfortable. Private bath on this little apartment had great design details including a heated towel rack. The main modest size living room had a very comfortable murphy bed. Large flat tv on the wall with movies, wicked fast Wi-Fi(faster than my house or work) with a large modern couch to chill on. There is also a wine type fridge that they put an assortment of beverages in. It has kitchenette type area nicely laid out in the hall to poor drinks or make a sandwich. Access was down the side of the house with your own gate/ entrance that works well. The view into the back yard was great or you can close the blinds and just do your own thing. House was in a great neighborhood and a $10 ride to downtown. Owners were gracious and kind to me and my daughter. They were not intrusive but just a text away if I needed something. This worked well for us.",
