  "text": "Ira and Terri were terrific hosts and their home was immaculate. A cool modern design with beautiful landscaping. Super comfortable. Very private and a perfect location near Zilker Park and nearby trail access. They were most welcoming and put us right at ease. Left us drinks in the fridge and homemade baked goods. Highly recommend!",
