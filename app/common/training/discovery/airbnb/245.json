  "text": "Ira and Terri were generous and thoughtful hosts. They created a binder of ideas of things to do in town. Terri even pulled out some toys for our daughter. They were very sweet and had us over for snacks one night. The studio was perfect for our family of three, it had just the right amount of space. It's very well kept, has all the amenities you could need and is a very stylish space. We loved how close we were to Zilker Park and Barton Springs- everything was walking distance, including some great restaurants. We highly recommend them and making a stop in their cozy home.",
