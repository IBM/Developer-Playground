  "text": "AWESOME LOCATION AND HOSTS!\r\nTerri and Ira made our stay wonderful with the attention they pay to every detail. From the snacks, drinks, toiletries and various pillow types, this is on par with a luxury hotel. The house is immaculate with the latest technology: large TV, Apple TV, sound system, own thermostat and super fast wifi. \r\nThe location is perfect if you are looking for activities downtown. Barton Springs is a short walk away, it will probably take you longer to drive and find parking than to walk. UBER is the way to go, we had a 2-3 minute wait time and fare to 6th street were $6, less than parking downtown. \r\nWe can't wait to come back and stay here again!",
