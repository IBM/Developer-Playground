  "text": "Ira and Terri were great hosts, very welcoming and thoughtful. They showed us around the studio when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. They also made themselves available  throughout our stay, in the event we needed anything. The studio was lovely. A beautiful and relaxing space, very clean, and lots of nice amentities (Apple TV with large viewing selection, lots of extra towels, drinks and other goodies, etc). Great neighborhood too -  bucolic, quiet, safe, and close to Barton Springs, lots of good restaurants, and downtown. I would definitely stay with Ira and Terri again. A note for people who are nervous around dogs: the resident dog has a lot of energy and takes time to warm up to strangers.",
