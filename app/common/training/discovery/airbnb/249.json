  "text": "My husband and I just took a long weekend trip to Austin to attend a best friend's wedding, and this was perfect for us. First off, Ira and Terri were incredibly gracious hosts who thought of everything including the special touch of a towel warmer in the bathroom. As soon as we arrived, they gave us the tour and the accommodations were just as described. There's a great ramen place (Tatsu-ya) and a Shake Shack within walking distance, and almost everything else is a low uber fare away. 100% recommend this place although we would love to keep it our little secret!",
