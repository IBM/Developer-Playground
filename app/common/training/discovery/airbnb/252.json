  "text": "Everything was beyond expectations. We had four adults and a child staying in Ira and Terri's \"mother-in-law\" quarters. Ira and Terri had an air mattress that we blew up for our kiddo in the bedroom, and the Murphy bed in the living room was great for the other adults, though the couch was also comfortable enough to sleep on. The quarters are beautifully decorated, and open onto a tranquil backyard with a grill, outdoor fireplace, and lots of seating. There was a wine fridge fully stocked with two bottles of wine, some beer, water, yogurt, and a delicious baked oatmeal with berries that Terri had prepared for us. There was also a single-serve coffee maker (though we preferred to take the short walk to Medici for our morning fix). The location was great too - beautiful neighborhood, just a short walk to several great spots (including Barton Springs and Zilker Park). Terri and Ira were out of town for the weekend, so we didn't see much of them, but they greeted us warmly, showed us around, and then checked to see how our stay had been when they returned just before we left.",
