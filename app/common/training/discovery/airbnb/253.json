  "text": "Ira and Terri were great hosts!  They made us feel very welcome.  I was new to Airbnb and they were so helpful in helping me maneuver through the process.  I really appreciate it! \r\nThe location of the studio was great.  Ira and Terri provided excellent instructions on accessing the property.  The studio was very homey.  We felt like we were just staying at a friendâ€™s house.  It was big enough to accommodate four of us.  The Murphy bed was easy to set up and it was soft as well!  We had plenty of clean white towels, soft down blankets, soft and hard pillows for different sleepers, extra soft toilet paper (no doubt the Charmin brand!!), excellent Starbucks coffee, and many more things available to us, of which we were not able to try (i.e. wine (red and white), sodas, juice, and snacks).  Basically, Ira and Terri though of everything and made sure we had everything. No doubt Ira and Terri helped made our experience in Austin a memorable one.  For that, thank you!",
