  "text": "This was my first Airbnb stay and I must say it will be hard to surpass.  The facility is accurately described, meticulously maintained, beautifully decorated and stocked with everything one could possibly need.  The bedding, sheets, towels, robes, closet space, bed comfort, and AV equipment - all ranked a perfect 10.  The Temperpedic bed is world class and the outside yard space is well landscaped and appointed with great furniture and a fire pit.\r\n\r\nThe home is only a few years old and the apartment was designed as a in-law apartment and is perfect for an Airbnb.  It is roomy, well lit, quiet and situated in a close-in neighborhood to downtown Austin.  Everything one could need is situated within 1 - 1.5 miles away.\r\n\r\nI stayed here as an alternative to the Hyatt Regency (as it was booked) and I have no negative comments at all.  Uber was ideal and only once (due to surge rush hour pricing) was more than a $7 fare to the Hyatt.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I never met Ira, but Terry is super pleasant and warm.  I highly recommend this property and will reach out to Ira and Terry if ever heading back to Austin.",
