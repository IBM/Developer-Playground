  "text": "Jessica was really nice.  She arrived on time and quickly showed me around and made sure I didn't have any questions.  The place itself was great.  Very clean, plenty of space, everything worked really well, including Sonos sound system and wifi.   Great location that makes walking to almost everything very easy.  Only downside is that Sonos speakers didn't work from the roofdeck.",
