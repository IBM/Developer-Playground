  "text": "Absolutely amazing house, location and hosts!  Incredible place to stay with great furniture (including on the rooftop patio!), very clean, and great (huge) bedding for the entire group.  The hosts were very accommodating in helping us make dinner reservations, navigate Austin itself, and even provided a laundry list of fun activities for us to do while in town.  The place is just a few minute walk from busy downtown streets with restaurants/bars, with an incredible view of the city from the living room/roof.\r\n\r\nWould love to stay here again, was an amazing place and experience for a big group!",
