  "text": "Devlin and his crew made us all feel incredibly welcome. The house was in the perfect location - walking distance to all the bars and restaurants. Before our arrival, he made sure that all of my questions were answered. When I called, his crew answered. When I had questions about the cooking utensils, they were at the house in less than 30-minutes to get us what we needed.\r\n\r\nI couldn't have asked for a better weekend, a more perfect house for a bachelorette party and a better crew to make us feel \"at home\".",
