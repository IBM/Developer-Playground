  "text": "Devlin was a great host.  He contacted me prior to arrival and provided great information about the house and surrounding area.  The location of the apartment is very convenient to downtown, local bars, and great food.  The townhouse itself was very cool, a modern design, a solid layout, and great views and outdoor space.  Recommended for anyone looking to book a large group.",
