  "text": "We had a wonderful stay here for ACL. The location was spot on right where we wanted to be to catch some low key nightlife after each day. The house fits large groups extremely comfortably and the view from the bedroom and rooftop is gorgeous. \r\n\r\nThe hosts made us feel super welcome by leaving us with a plentiful stocking of local brews and great tips as to where we could find good food and bars (although it's Austin, can you really miss that hard?).",
