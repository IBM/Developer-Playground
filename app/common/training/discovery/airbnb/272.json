  "text": "I had a really great time at Eric's apartment. His place is clean, comfortable and he and his other roommate are both great guys. Once we get in he gave us two keys so we can exit and enter the house at anytime. You will love to have breakfast and enjoy good music with the great LP collection that Josh owns. The apartment is pretty cool decorated and you will enjoy playing with Peanut, their dog. Bathroom, kitchen, living room, bed, everything they offer is clean and ready to use. \r\nThey provided us with clean towels and nice clean and comfortable sheets. The complex were they live is in a nice neighborhood, with lots of parking space. I strongly recommend that you close the deal if you are considering in staying at their place. \r\n\r\nWe had great time with Eric and Josh, we even hangout with Eric once, he took us to an awesome bar nearby the apartment. I hope I can find available space at their place on the next ACL Festival! \r\n\r\n- Hector.",
