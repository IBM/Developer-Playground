  "text": "Kumara is a super nice guy with a clean and modern apartment.  I stayed here for SxSWi 2013 and loved the fact that I could park my car in a secure parking lot and then take a $1 bus ride in to the middle of SxSW (much easier and cheaper then parking downtown or taking a taxi).  I would stay here again next year.",
