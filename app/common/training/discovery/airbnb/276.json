  "text": "I stayed at Kumara's place for a few days and I had a good time. The apartment is nice and conveniently located close to restaurants and pizza places, and just a few steps away from the bus stop. If you don't have a car, the bus will take you to UT and downtown in just a few minutes. Kumara is a great guy and he is happy to give useful tips and show you around if he can. If you ever happen to spend some days at his place, you won't regret it!",
