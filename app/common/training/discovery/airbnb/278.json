  "text": "Kumara was a great host overall. He was welcoming and came to the nearest intersection to receive us.  We really enjoyed the apartment. It was very clean, silent and exactly as described. There were lot of restaurants around in the walking distance. We had many guests visiting us during our stay and kumara was so nice and never complained about it. Overall I would highly recommend this place to any one and I would like to stay again in future.",
