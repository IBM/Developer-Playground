  "text": "Spent three months living here while I was interning in Austin. It has a fantastic location with lots of nearby restaurants / amenities, and also close to downtown. The room with a private bathroom is very spacious and comfortable, in fact the photos don't do it justice :-) Kumara is an extremely organized, friendly and accommodating guy... an ideal roommate. I had a great time here and recommend it in the strongest possible terms!",
