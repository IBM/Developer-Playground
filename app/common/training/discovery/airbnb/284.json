  "text": "The place was very nice and cozy, perfect for the 5 of us. The home was in a great location only a few minutes drive to downtown and South Congress. A quiet place to relax after a long day of hitting the town. Zach was a great host, he answered all the questions we had and was very accommodating with our check in & check out requests. We will definitely stay here again the next time in Austin. Thank you Zach.",
