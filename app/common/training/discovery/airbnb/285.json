  "text": "From the moment we contacted Michael Ann our vacation began. She is a kind and fun loving person. The reservation process was seamless, checking in was like meeting a family member and any further communications we have with Michael Ann was like chatting with a friend from home. \n\nOnce we arrived at the home the enchanting gardens welcome you and you feel as if you are in key west not Austin. The home itself is stunning and every convenience you could think of is available. I particularly liked the kitchen and the views from the living room. \n\nThe bedroom was spacious with a wonderful walk in closet, the living room has a great entertainment center available. \n\nThe neighborhood itself is very Austin. Well manicured gardens and very trendy looking homes around the neighborhood, wonderful for a jog during the morning. \n\nI can't recommend this piece of heaven enough. You'll have to try it to believe it.",
