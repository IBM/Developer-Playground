  "text": "I couldn't have asked for a better getaway spot! We went down to Austin for one night on Saturday with the intention of going out to 6th street for the evening and once we arrived at Michael's place we saw what a little oasis it was and we didn't even go out. If you're in need of a quiet, relaxing place to decompress and forget your troubles, this is the place for you! The garage apartment is very clean and cozy with a great kitchen stocked with all the utensils you'd need to cook with (we got up Sunday morning, bought breakfast food and made our own breakfast there instead of going out). I can't decide which feature about Michael's place is my favorite, but If I had to choose it would be the enclosed outdoor shower (don't worry, there's also a normal shower in the restroom inside). Michael Ann is the perfect host - very welcoming and she always responded in a timely manner to all of our questions. She is a wonderful person with a refreshing, free spirited attitude and I'm so glad to have met her.",
