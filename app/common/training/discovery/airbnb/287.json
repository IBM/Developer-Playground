  "text": "I loved this place! we booked with Michael the day of and she was able to accommodate us on New Year's Eve! it was like spending the night inside a treehouse, the garage apartment is perfect for a romantic getaway. we had 3 people stay and it was still very roomy! close enough to drive downtown and so perfect for a nice trip to Austin. I loved staying here, definitely coming back on our next trip to Austin!!!",
