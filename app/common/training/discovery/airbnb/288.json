  "text": "We had so much fun in Austin and our \"secret\" was staying at Michael Ann's. It was the perfect home away from home, and Michael Ann was the perfect host (there if we needed her, but never in the way). The apartment was delightful and fully equipped, and the Crestview neighborhood was great for exploring and perfect for taking walks. We look forward to going back soon, and of course we will stay at Michael Ann's!",
