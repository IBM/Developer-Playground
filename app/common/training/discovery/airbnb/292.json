  "text": "Michael Ann is a gracious and lovely host. She knows exactly how to make you feel welcome and comfortable during your stay. Her \"treehouse\" apartment is gorgeous and very inviting -- meticulously clean and such a beautiful space! I felt like I was at home the second I walked through the door. We loved all the windows and woke to peaceful wind chimes and birds chirping. The optional outdoor shower just added to the relaxing atmosphere. I will definitely stay at Michael Ann's the next time I visit Austin!",
