  "text": "What a nice place.  We had a great stay in this apartment.  It was spacious, the bed was comfy and it was one of the nicest places we have stayed in Austin using AirBnB.  The location was great,  there were great places nearby to eat and it was easy to get to as well.   I would recommend it if you are looking for a reasonably quiet neighborhood.   Michael was great as well.  Personable and very charming.  My wife and I had a great time",
