  "text": "Incredible time, gracious and accommodating, flexible host.  The apartment is GORGEOUS and so perfectly decorated, maintained, cleaned, and stocked.  We booked this apartment for our wedding night.  My wife was able to check in early since we had wedding stuff to do all day.  When we got there, she had some Topo Chico ready for us.  There's a piano, and the kitchen is stocked with enough stuff for an absolutely delicious breakfast the next morning (and Dunkin' Donuts coffee too!) on the balcony/patio.  We were disappointed that we weren't able to stay for the whole day or another night, if for no other reason than to use the private outdoor shower.  But we left early the next morning to go on our honeymoon, so we couldn't take advantage of all the amenities that \"The Treehouse\" has to offer.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience!",
