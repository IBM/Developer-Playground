  "text": "The rental was perfect for our stay in Austin!  Michael Ann greeted us when we arrived and we could not have asked for a better host!  She is very welcoming and accommodating.  The rental was very tranquil and relaxing and also impeccably clean.  It is centrally located in Austin and the neighborhood is very walkable.  The kitchen was also well stocked.  We felt like we were at home the minute we arrived!  If you want a beautiful and relaxing place to stay in Austin, look no further!  We enjoyed our stay and would stay here if our travels took us through Austin again.",
