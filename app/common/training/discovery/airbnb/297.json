  "text": "If things like cleanliness, comfort, relaxing, and warm conversation appeal to you even in the slightest, definitely stay here. This was my second time here and unfortunately will probably be my last. While I'm sure some people might actually dislike a warm reception, amazing kitchen, the charming character of the apartment, or the continuing list of great things about this apartment - I'm now one of those people most Austin residents speak ill of by moving to Austin. So instead of staying at Michael Ann's apartment whenever I travel to Austin for work, I'll just be recommending this new (seriously, like blocks away) neighbor to EVERYONE that needs a place to stay in Austin. \r\n\r\nA couple other details for those looking: \r\n\r\nI've had some really bad/slow WiFi at some places. This WiFi isn't sourced by fiber or anything, but it still measures against the one metric we all use for internet connections: streaming netflix an hbogo. (it's like 5-8Mbs)\r\n\r\nThis house has a lot of windows so if you can be as lucky as I was to stay here during two big lightning storms it's incredible. \r\n\r\nThe kitchen is pretty well stocked with tools. Not, like, there's a few spatulas stocked. More like I was able to make pesto with the food processor and bake salmon stocked. If you at all like cooking, this kitchen is what you want.",
