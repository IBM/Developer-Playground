  "text": "Michael Ann's space was great. It was easy to find, the location was excellent, and everything was just very, very comfortable. There was even a nice guidebook with instructions right when I got inside. She was nothing but kind and warm in all of our interactions, and even though I only saw her face-to-face one time, the entire visit was quite nice.\r\n\r\nI would definitely stay here again.",
