  "text": "Michael Ann was out of town when we arrived, but she gave us detailed instructions on how to access the apartment and how to treat the space. When we did finally meet her she was extremely welcoming and helpful helping us figure out what to do and where to go during our short stay. And the space is absolutely lovely! I personally enjoyed having the piano to play around with in my downtime! Overall, I don't think we could have had a better experience",
