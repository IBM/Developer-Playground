  "text": "Wow, what a wonderful stay in Michael Ann's fabulous tree house! She was so warm, welcoming, and loved sharing all of her inside scoop on Austin. We instantly felt right at home. We loved all the natural light, opening the windows and hearing the birds, the kitchen with filtered water, and the shower with wonderful water pressure. We did not have a car during our stay and loved to explore her neighborhood by foot and bike. There was a great little pizza/sandwich shop just down the block, lots of gyms a few blocks away, and best of all a Juiceland right down the street. We felt extremely safe exploring the neighborhood, even at night walking back from the bus. We walked two long blocks to the MetroRapid (803) which brought us through UT  and dropped us right in downtown Austin within half an hour. We are so thankful Michael Ann!",
