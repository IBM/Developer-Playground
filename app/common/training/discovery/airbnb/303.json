  "text": "Michael Ann was a fantastic host. Her home is beautiful and the surrounding neighborhood is quiet and well-maintained. We enjoyed taking a Sunday morning bike ride (with the bikes she graciously let us borrow) around the neighborhood. The outdoor shower was especially relaxing after a long day of traveling and exploring the city. Everything we needed was there waiting for us. We hope to be back soon!",
