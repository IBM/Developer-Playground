  "text": "Michael Ann was a terrific host and the \"garage\" apt was even better than the photos. The Crestview neighborhood is on the far north side of Austin. It is quiet and very residential, but it is an easy drive to all the Austin hotspots (downtown is about 15 minutes away). Loved the apt and would definitely come back!",
