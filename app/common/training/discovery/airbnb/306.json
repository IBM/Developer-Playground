  "text": "Michael Ann was very welcoming and attentive.  The apartment was as beautiful and comfortable as it looked in the pictures.  The kitchen was fully able to accommodate the preparation of a Thanksgiving feast; the shower was spacious; the bed was comfortable; the balcony was wonderfully in the trees, with bird songs and wind chines providing musical backdrop; the location was convenient to appropriate shopping (and to downtown if we had so desired) - overall a thoroughly wonderful place to stay while visiting Austion.  Highly recommended.  Just note, the apartment is a flight of stairs to this \"above the garage\" apartment - not an issue for us, but maybe for someone else.",
