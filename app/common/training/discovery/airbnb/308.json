  "text": "What a great airbnb property. Really. It is not easy to get the mix of spaciousness and cozy so exactly right, but Michael Ann does it extremely well. From superb communication to a most welcoming greeting, this is definitely one of my favorite airbnb experiences. The space is exactly as described (well better) . Super private and comfortable, there is nothing that has not been considered. The neighborhood is also perfect--none of the congestion found in other areas of Austin because of less population density, but all of the amenities nearby. Michael Ann left a perfect snack of nuts on the porch with gerber daisies the first night--a different and elegant touch. All in all, this is one of those rare finds that does exactly what airbnb is meant to do--connect people with hosts and places that cannot be replicated. Since I was visiting my daughter, she came over for dinner, to play games, etc., and it felt like being at home. Easy. Highly recommend this property.",
