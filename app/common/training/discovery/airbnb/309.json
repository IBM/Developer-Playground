  "text": "Michael Ann was a wonderful and welcoming host.  the apt was clean and homey and ready for us when we arrived.  The backyard and outdoor shower were great. We wanted to stay in this neighborhood because we wanted to stay close to friends but there are plenty of good restaurants nearby - Fonda San Miguel, Peach taco, La Mancha, Torchy's, and Central market with outdoor seating and playground is close by.  We enjoyed staying here!",
