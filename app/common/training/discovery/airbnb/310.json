  "text": "We loved this tree house apartment. It was so comfy and cozy, we wish we had more time to relax and enjoy it. Michael Ann was so hospitable and friendly! The juice shop and taco deli walking distance were great as well as the pizza/deli down the street. We were probably 10-15 minutes from downtown so it was great to be out of the hectic city. The price was great and we hope to be back. We would recommend this place to anyone interested! Oh and the bed was so comfy!! Thanks michael ann for a great weekend experience!",
