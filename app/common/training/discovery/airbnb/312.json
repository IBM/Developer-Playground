  "text": "I was so sad to leave this amazing space. The decor is fabulous and there is not a hospitality detail missed. Michael Ann has created the perfect space for any and all visitors from a romantic getaway to a simple business trip like mine. It is the perfect balance of whimsy and practicality. And to be honest, the pictures don't do it justice!  \r\n\r\nWhat a great place with a phenomenal host. I will be back Michael Ann!",
