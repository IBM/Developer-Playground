  "text": "This was the best AirBnB experience I've had by far. Michael Ann was an amazing host. From her attention to detail and the warmth of how she welcomes you...there were beers and goodies in the fridge. She even brought us a bottle of wine and eggs for breakfast. There really are no words for how wonderful and thoughtful she is.  Her Treehouse is gorgeous, the pictures really don't do it justice.  It was immaculate with everything you could possibly need.  Very well stocked kitchen, clean linens, and towels.  It has everything you could possibly need and more! Not to mention her beautiful backyard with the huge trees, it's a little piece of heaven.  We loved staying here and if you are ever in Austin, this would be the only place you would want to stay.",
