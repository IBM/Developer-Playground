  "text": "Michael Ann was a lovely host, greeted us with a bit of groceries and made us feel at home!  The 'Tree House' had loads of charm & character and just as described.  The backyard was peaceful and the decor was adorable.  The neighborhood was very quiet and allowed for some nice nights sitting out on the balcony and relaxing.  The piano allowed for my wife to see how much she remembered playing some songs which made for a really memorable night.  Would definitely recommend!  Thanks for everything Michael Ann!",
