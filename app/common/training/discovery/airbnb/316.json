  "text": "Beautiful garage apartment, just as described! The space is located in a quiet, dreamy suburban neighborhood on the outskirts of Austin. Our host was extremely friendly and amendable. My only regret is that my girlfriend and I didn't stay here the whole time we were in Austin!\r\n\r\nOur host let us ride her beach cruiser bicycles housed in the garage. The neighborhood is all completely flat, perfect for a morning or evening stroll on a sunny day. Even more perfect after a morning spent taking an outdoor shower! What a perfect little space!",
