  "text": "We loved our stay!  The apartment was beautifully decorated and complete with all amenities.  Michael Ann was so nice and very accommodating.   We arrived late on our first night and Michael Ann put beer and snacks in the frig and made sure we had coffee and eggs inn the morning.  The couch pull out bed was surprisingly comfortable.  The backyard looks like something out of Better Homes and Gardens.  I highly recommend this Treehouse Apartment.",
