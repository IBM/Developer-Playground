  "text": "This is the second time in six months that I have stayed at Michael Ann's amazing respite, and that should say it all. My husband and I were traveling for a few weeks, and knowing that we would need a rest before the final push home, we stayed here for three nights. All the things I look for apply to this lovely Austin apartment--great location, as advertised (better actually), excellent communication, super clean, etc. But what I cannot figure out is how she knows exactly what a traveler needs and provides it so effortlessly in this cozy (not sterile) place. It is all there, as well as many other touches that go well beyond the typical airbnb properties (and they are always excellent in my experience). Super comfy bed, gourmet kitchen, a walk-in room/closet that is a brilliant use of space, and a desk that any writer would want to sit at and work. Plus outdoor areas that include an outdoor shower (in addition to the one in the apartment). And above all, a caring host. Be sure to visit the Little Deli up the street for the Margarita pizza and turkey sandwich, and take a run on Bull Shoal or a swim in two nearby municipal pools. Such a great place for a vacation.",
