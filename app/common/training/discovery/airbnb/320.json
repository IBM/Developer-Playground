  "text": "My husband and I absolutely loved Michael Ann's beautiful garage apartment! The location was perfect for exploring everything Austin has to offer, even Lake Travis, which was an easy AND scenic 30 minute drive away. The apartment itself was the perfect size for 2-4 people. Very cozy yet private and separate from the main home. It seemed like each morning, I noticed a new unique piece of artwork on the walls, or an antique item I had glanced over before. The decor brought back memories of staying with grandparents as a child, all the way down to the beautifully treed backyard. \nMichael Ann herself was extremely attentive and so welcoming! She offered up beers and snacks on our first night and regularly made sure we had everything we needed. \nWe will be recommending her place to all our friends and family who visit the area, and hopefully be back ourselves one day!",
