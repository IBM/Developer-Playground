  "text": "Love this perfectly relaxing apartment! Michael Ann is the sweetest host - helpful, welcoming, responsive and has thought of everything. The space is so cozy with beautiful decorative touches, you'll feel at home right away. The kitchen is well-stocked for your cooking needs, and there are plenty of extra linens. We were so sad to leave! Would definitely recommend; to be able to call a place like this home for a few days helped make wonderful Austin even more enjoyable.",
