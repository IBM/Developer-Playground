  "text": "I found this little gem to be unbelievably beautiful and peaceful. Nestled in the treetops on a quiet street, the Treehouse was especially tranquil. The apartment was beautifully appointed with a little bit of funky ATX vibe, but still classy and elegant. The kitchen was gorgeous and well stocked. This place was perfect for me and I hope to return many times in the future.",
