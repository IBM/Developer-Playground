  "text": "Michael Ann's place was fabulous. The place really felt like a home. \r\nThe pictures do not do it justice. And she was fabulous herself. So helpful.  It is one of the best Airbnb places I have stayed, and I have been in a lot. And if you like to cook, it is certainly the most complete kitchen I have seen.  Enjoy her place, and book early.",
