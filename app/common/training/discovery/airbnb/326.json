  "text": "We were searching for last minute accommodations and Lisa was very accommodating! Although she wasn't able to meet us for check-in,  it was very easy to get into the house and she left a note for us. She was also available by phone for any questions we had. The house is very cute, artsy and in a great location- in the heart of east Austin and a quick cab ride to downtown. I recommend this house to anyone coming to Austin for a nice weekend getaway. I would definitely stay here again!",
