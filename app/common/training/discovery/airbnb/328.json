  "text": "When we went to austin, we didn't know exactly where to stay, in terms of proximity to downtown/events, etc.  Turns out being a bit further east at Lisa's place was perfect.  We rented bikes from the eastside peddle pushers and cruised the whole city!  It was such a relief to get out of downtown at the end of the night, and the 15 minute safe, easy, flat bikeride back to the bungalo was exactly what we needed. It was quiet, funky, honest and down-home.  We felt right at home and really loved the area: mixed industrial/arts community, amazing street art/grafity, un-gentrified and real.  I'd stay at Lisa's again for sure.  We texted her a few times to get info about local stuff and she was very helpful.",
