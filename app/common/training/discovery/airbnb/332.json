  "text": "Lisa's bungalow is wonderful. It perfectly accommodated four people, and could have fit a couple more on the couches. Spacious and in such a cute neighborhood! Lisa wasn't able to meet up with us for check-in, but it was super easy to find it and get into the house. Within walking distance to the lake and pretty close to downtown- we took a cab because it was too far for us to walk. We had no issues arise and would highly recommend it to anyone!",
