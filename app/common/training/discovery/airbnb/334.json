  "text": "Lisa's Eastside Bungalow is a sweet spot in Austin, convenient to everything and walkable to a few yummy restaurants/cafes/and juices galore! Her two-bedroom, one-bath home provided a great spot for a couple and one friend to retreat. The space was clean and there were plenty of towels/sheets. There is a full kitchen with tea provided, though you'll need to bring salt/pepper and any spices if you plan to cook much! Thanks for a great stay!",
