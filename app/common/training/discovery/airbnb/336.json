  "text": "Lisa is really cool, fun and likeable.  And guess what? Her lovely house is exactly like that too.  When I arrived I spent a while taking snapshots all over the house, and then I took a short little stroll around the neighbourhood and really enjoyed taking in the atmosphere. It's a great part of town, and close enough to downtown to walk if you want to. Lisa was very easy and gracious to deal with, always patient and good-humoured.  If you stay anywhere else in Austin, it will be your loss.",
