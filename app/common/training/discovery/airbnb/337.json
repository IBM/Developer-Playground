  "text": "Lisa has an incredibly clean and well maintained property which she has listed on Airbnb.  We had a couple of questions and Lisa answered them in a timely manor.  I highly recommend booking a stay with Lisa, the location is perfect for anyone taking a trip to Austin, TX and the recommendations she gives for food are fantastic.  The listing matched the actual house perfectly and the central air seems like it will be essential during Austin's heat waves.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find good art on the walls.  Many Airbnb homes feel plain, but Lisa's house was wall to wall with great art to look at.  Essentially Lisa's home is a \"not to be missed\" resource on Airbnb.",
