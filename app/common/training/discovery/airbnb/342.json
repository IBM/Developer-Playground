  "text": "Staying at Lisa's was a great mini getaway! First of all, Lisa was great before we got there, sending us information about tons of local things to do. When we did arrive, the house was awesome! Just enough space for a small group. It was decorated with some cool art, and murals. Location was very accessible to all of the fun things we did, barton springs, 6th street night life, and FOOD TRUCKS...tons of yummy food trucks! I got a chance to meet Lisa and her family and they were  wonderful. I am thinking about moving to Austin and she had lots of helpful advice and knowledge of the area. When I go back to apartment/job hunt I would definitely stay at Lisa's again!",
