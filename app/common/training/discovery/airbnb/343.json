  "text": "Very cute place!  Very short drive/cab ride to east 6th area, downtown. Couple of coffee shops in walking distance.  Nice backyard. Central air conditioning was amazing for summer in Austin. Quiet neighborhood.  Easy parking.  Seamless \"check-in\" and \"check-out.\"  The cleaning lady promptly arrived at 11 AM on check out day.  Thanks Lisa!",
