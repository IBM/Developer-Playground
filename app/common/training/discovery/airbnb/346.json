  "text": "Our stay at Lisa's cozy little bungalow was perfect! The place was in a great location close to everything we needed. We got the opportunity to meet Lisa and chat with her briefly. She was very warm and friendly, offering advice on places to eat. The check in and check out process was easy and hassle free. We would definitely stay here again for future Austin visits!",
