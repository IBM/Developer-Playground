  "text": "Our experience was an amazing one! This was our 3rd time in Austin within ONE month and I think we have fell in love with this city. Lisa was great - she made us feel right at home - Very easy to communicate with! Her place was very clean and tidy - very comfortable! The neighborhood was safe and the location was perfect, since we spent majority of our time in Downtown Austin.",
