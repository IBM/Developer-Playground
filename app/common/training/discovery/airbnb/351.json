  "text": "Charming bungalow in a great location east of downtown. The bungalow is clean, well-decorated, well-furnished, and the embodiment of Austin's \"quirckiness\", which I love. The location on the east side of downtown is both convenient and does not seem subject to the traffic that often plagues Austin. Lisa, the hostess, is both responsive and accomodating. She checked in with us during our stay to see if we needed anything.\r\n\r\nI would stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a great and affordable alternative to the generic hotels often found around the town.",
