  "text": "Staying at Lisa's place is an insight into the real gem that is Austin. Her spacious house has great art work in every nook and cranny, while around the corner there is an amazing fresh juice bar. It's only a short cab ride (~$20) away from the heart of downtown, but far enough to feel like a residential escape from the bustle of the city.",
