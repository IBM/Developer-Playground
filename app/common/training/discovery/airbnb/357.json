  "text": "My 2 girlfriends and I had a great stay at this cozy little bungalow! Just minutes from many downtown attractions/hot spots made it easy and convenient. The bungalow was clean and homy, and we spent most of our evenings and some mornings on the back deck chatting and drinking tea or coffee. Lisa was great at keeping in touch the days leading up to the trip as well as while we were there. She very much gave us our privacy during our stay. Comfortable beds and decent amenities made this such a breeze for us - especially for us 2 out-of-towners experiencing Austin for the first time!",
