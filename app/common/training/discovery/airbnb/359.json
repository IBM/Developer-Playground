  "text": "Lisa was great! She provided us with helpful recommendations on places to go locally, and took the time to check in via text messages to make sure we were having a good time. She was even kind enough to let us stay past checkout, since there were no other guests coming right away, and our flight wasn't until late evening so there was no easy place to store our bags. We really appreciated her flexibility and understanding. Thank you Lisa for helping my friend and I enjoy our stay in Austin!",
