  "text": "Lisa was attentive and very welcoming even though we never met in person! Very communicative and pleasant.  House was great, just as described and pictured.  It's cute, quaint and funky - just like Austin :) Neighborhood was quiet and still close to lots of fun things.  Loved all the fun art and having the juice bar right down the street, so convenient after a day/night of festing.  Thanks, Lisa!!",
