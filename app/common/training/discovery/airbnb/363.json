  "text": "Lisa was a FANTASTIC host. This is the first time I have ever used air bnb and her house made our trip for ACL so great. It's very nicely decorated and had a very homey vibe. We were idiots and locked ourselves out twice on accident and she was completely understanding and helped us get back inside. I would recommend this neighborhood for your stay in Austin. It's down the street from a juice land, which was a magical place and only about a $15 ride to the festival. Our stay was unforgettable! Thanks Lisa!",
