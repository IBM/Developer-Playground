  "text": "Lisa's communication was prompt and clear, and her house is just as pictured in the photos. Quiet neighborhood, walking distance to a few restaurants and bars (we liked the Tamale House for brunch) with easy access to other parts of Austin ($9 uber to downtown). \r\n\r\nHeads up that the two beds are full size instead of queen and the mattress was quite uncomfortable. My fianc√© and I only stayed one night, so it wasn't a problem for us, but I would want to know a detail like that before I booked this place for a week.",
