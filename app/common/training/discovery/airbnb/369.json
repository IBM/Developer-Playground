  "text": "Lisa was a great host, she responded to all communication quickly and efficiently. She was very flexible plus she left great suggestions for bars and food. The place was as described, comfortable, cool and in a trendy neighbourhood, which we loved!  We found it quite easy to get around especially with the new bikes which you can park about 4 blocks from the house. Thanks Lisa!",
