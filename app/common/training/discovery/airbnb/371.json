  "text": "We had a lovely stay at Lisa's bungalow. Her communication was very clear, done far in advance and she also checked in with us right before our trip to make sure we had everything we needed. The space is great for four people for a long weekend. It is located on a quaint little street that is accessible, by walking,to lots of cafes and bars/restaurants as well as buses!",
