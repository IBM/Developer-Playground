  "text": "Lisa's bungalow is just great. It's bright, spacious, has a great layout, and an awesome backyard. When I walked through the front door, I felt like I just walked into a friends place...such a good vibe! Lisa was great with communication, even around such a busy weekend, and checked on us after a particularly tempestuous thunderstorm to make sure we were alright. I would definitely stay here again.",
