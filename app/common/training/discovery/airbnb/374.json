  "text": "We received an e-mail in advance with everything we needed to know. \r\n\r\nThere were fresh flowers on the counter and Lone Star beers in the fridge when we arrived - whoohoo! Welcome to Texas!\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was urban, but it seemed like a very quiet street - and it was. We were close to everything.\r\n\r\nLisa was very responsive via text and e-mails to our needs. Example: there was an issue with one of the blinds. I texted her and she came the next day and fixed while we were out sightseeing.\r\n\r\nBungalow was super cute, and everything we needed was there. \r\nWe'd definitely stay here again.\r\n\r\nOnly comment, and it's not really negative: old Austin houses settle over time. As such, the doors are not quite true, so they can stick or not close smoothly. Not a big deal to us at all, and somewhat out of our host's hands. But if that sort of thing bugs you, wanted to point it out.",
