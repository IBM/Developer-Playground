  "text": "Lisa sent over very detailed instructions the week of the rental and everything was incredibly straightforward. She texted the day of check-in to make sure everything was okay and let me know that she would be available if I needed anything. Luckily there were no issues and so I didn't have to disturb her during the stay at all.\r\n\r\nMy trip was partially revolving around work and then a girls weekend getaway. The beds were very comfortable and easily fit the 4 of us. We had a rental car and it was great to not have to worry about parking since there was a private driveway. At nights, we took Ubers to and from dinner/drinks and the price was very reasonable.\r\n\r\nGreat experience overall and would definitely recommend to others!",
