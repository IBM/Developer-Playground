  "text": "This was such a great little place to stay. Lisa was warm, friendly, and flexible. The bungalow was clean with really fun decor. The back patio was a great place to sit with a glass of wine. It was a cheap Uber ride to South Congress and 6th Street, and there were some really good coffee shops and restaurants right in the neighborhood. My only tiny quibble is that there's not a lot of indoor light, but if you're using this house as a base to explore the city, like we were, it's not an issue. Not even taking off a star for it.",
