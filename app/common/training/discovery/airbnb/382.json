  "text": "We stayed at Lisa's for a few days while we explored Austin, and the place was perfect! A working kitchen, lots of outdoor space, and close to plenty of delicious food! We put bikes together and rode all over town from her house. The place was clean and well equipped with everything we needed including a comfortable bed and deluxe shower. The art on the walls was so interesting and eclectic eith a great feel. And of course, Lisa was extremely sweet and communicative! Just another tip: If you stay here you MUST eat breakfast tacos at Veracruz on Cesar Chavez. We ate there all three mornings that we were in town!",
