  "text": "Two girlfriends and I rented Lisa's place for a ladies weekend. The house itself is really cute and comfortable. There were plenty of towels and dishes and the house was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood had some cool things nearby that were easy to walk to. Lisa was very communicative with us. Would definitely stay here again.",
