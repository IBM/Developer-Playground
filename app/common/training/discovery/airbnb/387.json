  "text": "Loved the neighborhood and the bungalow-style house! We had a group of friends for a weekend trip and absolutely would stay here again. It was a short walk to the lake and several fabulous bars and restaurants. Loved the eclectic art and cozy atmosphere. Lisa was very responsive and full of great recommendations for local food and fare. Highly recommend this place.",
