  "text": "Lisa was a great host, the place was adorable and very comfortable.  The street is quiet and near an amazing park and running path.  The backyard was also great, we had our morning coffee there and just enjoyed the peace and quiet.  Easy car ride from the airport and to downtown as well.  Would definitely recommend Lisa's place and she was the perfect host.  We had everything we needed.",
