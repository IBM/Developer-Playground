  "text": "Amazing, wonderful little place. Very heart-warming art-filled environment. We felt like we were in a mini art gallery- the art kept us all  entertained and in awe the whole visit:). Very spacious and clean, it didn't at all fill like 700 sq feet it is. The outdoor space is equally friendly and comfortable- super cute front and back yard. Great location. Enjoyed the walk to juiceland for some healthy tonics, coffee and donuts at Friends and Neighbors, beer from East 1st Grocery, dinner at the nearby food trucks and had a longer 35 min, unexpected walk to 6th street just because the evening was nice and wanted to keep exploring. Such a great experience. Can't wait to stay here again. Thank you Lisa! Love love love your space!",
