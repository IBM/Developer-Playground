  "text": "My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Eastside Bungalow! The place is super cute & welcoming (there's lots of great art & records to peruse). Lisa made getting in super easy, and it was only a 20 min walk to downtown. She also had great recommendations for bars and good eats. I would highly recommend this listing for anyone looking to enjoy the fun of Austin, but still want a quiet and relaxing getaway.",
