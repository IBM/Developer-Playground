  "text": "We loved this cute little house so much! It was perfect for our stay in Austin. East Austin is such a cool area with lots of neat places to eat and drink and explore- and this house is perfectly situated to both be near neat stuff but also be a bit off the beaten path. The host was very easy to work with and very accommodating. She had a portable crib that we were able to use for our little one and also made recommendations of good family friendly things to do in the area. She was overall very hospitable, easy to contact and friendly.",
