  "text": "Lisa's place was great. Felt like we were staying with a friend. Very clean, funky neighborhood, good for kids. Quiet at night. We walked (well, I walked and my kids scootered) to breakfast at Cisco. Lisa was great with communication and super accommodating. We only stayed one night, but would definitely stay with her again.",
