  "text": "The bungalow was clean and comfortable.  It looks a little different then the picture as there is a fence in front of it with a number of things in the front yard.  But, it was a great place to stay.  We felt safe, and enjoyed the quiet neighborhood.  We also enjoyed what was supplied so that we could make a few of our own meals.",
