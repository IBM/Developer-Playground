  "text": "Lisaâ€™s place is perfectly located in a funky, (in the best way possible) up and coming eastside neighborhood.  Very quiet and a good base for exploring Austin. Close to everything and walking distance to some good eats and drinks. Great communications and she was very responsive from the beginning .  We would  most definitely stay there again when we return to Austin!!",
