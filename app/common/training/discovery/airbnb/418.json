  "text": "Lisa's east side bungalow was just perfect for our short stay in Austin. It's conveniently located for tourists and is in a nice and quiet neighborhood with some good coffee shops, juice bars etc. The place was clean and cute and Lisa was responsive and helpful. We'd recommend it to anyone heading to Austin!",
