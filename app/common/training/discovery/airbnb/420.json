  "text": "We had such a great stay in Austin. We LOVED Lisa's house. It's an absolute gem, brimming with personality. We were very comfortable and found the area to be warm and welcoming. The neighborhood is fantastic with spots within walking distance. We immediately became addicted to Juiceland (which is right around the corner). Every other neighborhood is super easy to catch a cab to. We would definitely stay with her again.",
