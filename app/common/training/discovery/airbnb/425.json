  "text": "Everything about the listing was spot on. The house was fun and bright in a quiet residential area that was close enough to either walk, ride the bus, or take an inexpensive ride to all the things I was interested in visiting while in town. Lisa's neighborhood recommendations were great and a nice change of pace from the more touristy parts of Austin. Check-in and check out were both easy and hassle free as everything is clearly explained beforehand. Staying at Lisa's place was definitely a highlight of my visit to Austin.",
