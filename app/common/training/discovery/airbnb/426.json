  "text": "My friends and I stayed at Lisa's very cute and functional house for 4 nights during Austin City Limits festival. Her house was very clean and the kitchen had everything required for cooking meals. Easy to find, plenty of room for 4 of us and the backyard was big and nice to hang out in. The neighborhood was very safe and the location was close to everything. I would recommend staying at Lisa's for any visit to Austin!",
