  "text": "We had a perfect experience at the bungalow! It was very clean, organized, and decorated exceptionally. We loved the art. It was such a cute spot we had a hard time leaving to go explore Austin at times! A very helpful guidebook was left by the host which detailed all the cool spots to go in the neighborhood. We walked around to shops, cafes, and of course juice land, and even to downtown although that was a bit far. Just wished we could have stayed for longer!",
