  "text": "Matt was an incredible host. He was very prompt to respond to any questions I had and left great instructions on entering and departing. The neighborhood has a very homey feel to it.\r\n\r\n We stayed at his house for ACL weekend and had no problem biking to and from the festival. His place slept 8 comfortably - two to a bed. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a launch pad for Austin.",
