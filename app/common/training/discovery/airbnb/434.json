  "text": "Fiona was very communicative and helpful during the check in process which was really very easy.  The cottage is in a great location, super close to many bars and my favorite food truck in Austin :) It's a quaint little studio cottage with plenty of space.  Only things to note are that there are no doors, not even to the bathroom (separated with a curtain).  So it's a good place for 1 person or perhaps a couple.  It's definitely got the artsy Austin feel to it which is awesome.  Thanks Fiona!",
