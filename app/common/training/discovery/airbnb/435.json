  "text": "The property was very well kept inside and warm.  It is ideal for a single person or couple.  Fiona is very communicative through every step of the process and was extremely hospitable.  She really knows the area well and gave great instructions and help evening giving me a ride. In addition, it only took me about 20 mins or so to walk to the convention center and a cab from the location is only about $6.  I would totally stay there again.",
