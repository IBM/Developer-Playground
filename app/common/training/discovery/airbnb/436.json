  "text": "Great location, and highly conducive to bike riders. The house itself is awesome with a fun artistic flare! Best for people who know each other pretty well as there is no real door on the bathroom, simply a curtain :) really liked Fiona, she was very nice, considerate, flexible, and accommodating. I'd definitely stay here again!",
