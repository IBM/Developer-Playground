  "text": "My friend and I stayed in Austin for the Funfunfun Fest and Boy it was fun!    Austin is amazing. Fiona's cottage was just what we were looking for.   It was clean and quite cheerful.  The walls are all a different bright color making it impossible to wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  Fiona was also very quick to respond to my e-mails, and greeted us right when we arrived.  She was a great host.  The cottage is also in a good neighborhood and is pretty close to 6th street where all the nightlife is.  All and all a great trip.",
