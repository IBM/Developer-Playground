  "text": "Not only was this place every bit as beautiful as the photographs, but Fiona took care of me like an honored guest and saw to so many little touches that made my stay special. During SXSW madness, instead of the insanity of the downtown hotel scene, I got a calm temple of sleep where morning birdsong, wifi, and a french press ready to make coffee were mine without leaving my pajamas! Easy walk or bike from downtown, inexpensive cab ride, even pedicabs will take you back here, and there are some great restaurants not far away. Highly recommended.",
