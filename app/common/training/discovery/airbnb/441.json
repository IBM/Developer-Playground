  "text": "We could not have lucked out more! Fiona is truly gracious and helpful host. Her communication is right on point, always responds very quickly and thoughtfully. A joy working with her. The cottage is just adorable. Reminded me of the house I used to rent when I lived in Austin once upon a time.. We rented bikes (at Fiona's suggestion!) and could easily be downtown in 10 minutes. Very close to convention center, awesome East side bars and local favorite, Juan in a Million!  We stayed during SxSw and had a wonderful, wonderful experience. Thanks Fiona & Airbnb!",
