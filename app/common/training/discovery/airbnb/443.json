  "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking to spend a relaxing long weekend in Austin, and we found it here at Fiona's place! The cottage was great to come back to after a long day running around town. We rented a car just because we planned to travel out of the city a bit, but it's location near public transit makes it easy to get around. Fiona was a wonderful host and offered helpful suggestions on where to catch a bite to eat as well as nice day trips away from Austin. Next time we make it to Austin, we'll definitely stay here again.",
