  "text": "This was a great spot to land on our very first night in Austin. We walked from Fiona's cottage up to the White Horse and caught some live music and tacos - and spent the next few days wandering around the area, biking down to Ladybird Lake and exploring east Austin. Ultimately it's not the neighborhood we decided to live in, but we enjoyed it for a few nights. The area is definitely \"up and coming\" and changes block by block -- but the location of this property is on a very quiet, quaint street that felt very safe. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that was a little weird about the property was that the bathroom doesn't have a door -- just a curtain -- and it's right next to the bed. I noticed that you can see this from the photos Fiona posted but I just wanted to point it out as I didn't pick up on it before we checked in. \r\n\r\nFiona was a great host and very quick to answer our questions but also gave us our privacy. Would definitely recommend staying here!",
