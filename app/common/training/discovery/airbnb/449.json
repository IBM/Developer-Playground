  "text": "As if Austin needs *another* selling point! Fiona's place - and all her helpfulness - are yet more highlights of this awesome town.\r\n\r\nIf you want a launch site to 6th Street's attractions and surrounds (both the major neon ones closer to the city and the uber hipster joints further east), this is a great place to stay. We easily walked to all the music, food, and atmosphere we felt like taking in. And it was pretty easy to work out public transport options, too (the excellent wifi will help you plan everything, too!).\r\n\r\nFiona is a great host and a fine ambassador for the neighborhood (which we would happily have wandered around even more for the State Cemetery, French Legation, groovy bars, good food, and generally chilled out vibe). So if you want to hang out amongst all the action OR do the complete opposite and retreat from the world, this place will work for you.",
