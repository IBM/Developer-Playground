  "text": "Fiona's place was great, really cute and creative, just as advertised. She was also really friendly and great to book with, though we didn't get to meet her personally since she was out of town. I loved the house and the neighborhood - it's been one of my favorite Airbnb experiences. We were tired of the SoCo experience in Austin, and I much prefer the area the cottage is in. The tacqueria down and across the street is good for a cheap, hot breakfast, plus you're near all the great spots in Austin. We paddleboarded on the lake, caught a concert, ate good food and just generally hung out and had a great time. Definitely want to come back.",
