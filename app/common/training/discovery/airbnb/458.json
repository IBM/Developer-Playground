  "text": "Easy breezy. Fiona was super accommodating, the cottage was clean and adorable, and we had no problems whatsoever. Like others said, the bathroom does only have a curtain and is right next to the bed... but if you go with someone you are super close with, this shouldn't be an issue. Also, it is true what they say, the parking out front is incredibly easy, and not something to worry about at all. \r\nWe didn't meet Fiona while we were there, but she made it super easy to get in and out... and also didn't bug us about a check out time, which was helpful the day after a rowdy wedding ;-).",
