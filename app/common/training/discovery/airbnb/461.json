  "text": "Fiona was a great host, and the little cottage is straight-up adorable. I'm still newish to this Airbnb business, so I showed up on the wrong doorstep (Fiona's home rather than the adjacent cottage), and she was more than gracious about it, walking me over to show me how to use some appliances and such. She also gave me great input on places to eat in the area. The location is fantastic, too. I headed out for a walk to one of the recommended restaurants and ended up spending the day tooling around downtown on foot. I really didn't appreciate how close this east-side spot was to everything. The state Capitol is about two miles away. The only hitch with the location is that my online maps had a little trouble finding it, and so did the cab driver who came to pick me up for the airport. I think GPS really wants to put you on the next street over, so it's something to keep in mind. Also, I stayed here solo -- totally perfect and half the price of the Sheraton would've been -- but if I'd been with someone other than my husband, the bathroom might have been too close to the bed to feel comfy. That said, the bathroom is one of the coolest-looking parts of the place. All in all, it's a perfect little spot to have your own kitchen in an interesting part of town rather than a stale hotel room. Definitely recommend.",
