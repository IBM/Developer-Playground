  "text": "Fiona was an awesome host!! Her home was super cute and you can't beat the location! A real easy drive to where we wanted to be and right around the corner from one of my favorite Cafe's in Austin--Cenote. Definitely a bonus. ;)  If you're going to be in the area, I'd definitely recommend Fiona's. She's really down to earth and will make sure you're well taken care of without being all up in your face about it. :) :)",
