  "text": "I travel a lot for work. I was looking for a local Austin experience.  When I arrived Fiona had some Lone Stars in the fridge and hearing my back was sore she brought over a rolling pad. Nice touch! Fiona was super friendly, knowledgeable and hospitable. The place was a easy walk to the heart of sixth street and there is a cool local spot near by with good live music. The cottage was perfect!!!\r\nI will definitely be staying here next year if its open. Great place!!!\r\nThanks,\r\nFiona",
