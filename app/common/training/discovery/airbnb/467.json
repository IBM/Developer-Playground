  "text": "I came here for SXSW and it was the perfect little place and location for me!  I used to live in Austin so I knew the area really well and was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go.  Fiona was very nice and welcoming, and the space she made is so lovely!  I highly recommend it for a solo traveler, close couple or best friends.  (The bathroom has no door, just curtain)  I would definitely stay here again!",
