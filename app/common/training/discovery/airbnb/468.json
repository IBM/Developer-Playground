  "text": "The personality of Fiona's cottage is very fun. We enjoyed being able to walk from the cottage downtown along the river, though we did not feel very safe walking directly back to the cottage from downtown at night. Walking 15 minutes to Rainey Street, a fun bar district, was very worth it. \r\nWe were disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the cottage, such as unemptied trash cans and a dirty floor. There was also some confusion about how to get into the cottage when we arrived, and Fiona was not available when we first arrived.   \r\nThe setup of the bathroom with a curtain for a door is also some thing that visitors need to consider. I really wished that I had more privacy than that!",
