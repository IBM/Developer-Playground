  "text": "Such a fun, cheerful little cottage!  We could tell a lot of creative effort had gone into the decor.  Lovely.  The lake is just a short walk away, and if you walk past the I35 bridge on the path, you can find cheap kayak rentals (and other random water vessels).  Fiona and Brian were very friendly, and helpful with suggestions.  Definitely recommended.  (We were too lazy to do the full walk to 6th street, so we drove halfway and parked for free.  Too easy.)",
