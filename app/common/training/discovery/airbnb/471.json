  "text": "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fiona's east side cottage. It was the perfect place for us to use as a home base while we met up with old friends around town. It's in a quiet little neighborhood really close to downtown and all your east side favorites. I am an Austin native and would highly recommend staying here to get an authentic feel for the city. Thank you Fiona for sharing the cottage with us and look forward to staying here next time were in town!",
