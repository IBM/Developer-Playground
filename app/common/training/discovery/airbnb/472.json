  "text": "Fiona's cottage was absolutely awesome and so charming. Fiona and her partner were also super nice. We arrived and the cottage was  clean and comfy and there were even some beers in the fridge. The shower had a great Rainbath-ish shower head. The AC was cold and the room stayed dark enough to comfortably sleep it off after a night of partying. Which makes this place even cooler, because my boyfriend and I could walk to downtown in 15-20 minutes or so. This was my first time using Airbnb and I couldn't be happier. Thank you so much for ruling!",
