  "text": "Fiona's place was perfectly sized for one, with ample living area and closet space, and comfortable air conditioning and window shades to keep everything cool during the day. There wasn't a hair dryer available at first, but Fiona brought one over right away when I inquired, which was great. The bed is a wee bit short if you're tall, but still very comfortable to sleep on.\r\n\r\nI was easily able to park right out front for easy car access, or stroll through the neighborhood to get downtown/further explore the east side on foot. Overall, a great little place, and a wonderful weekend in Austin!",
