  "text": "If I could add another star I would.\r\nFiona was incredibly easy to contact and quick to respond; although, everything was set-up so nicely that the need to contact her after I arrived was non-existent. This was bay far the best Airbnb experience I have had.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was fantastic: Great location, super cute and clean, and well appointed. I was so charmed by the place that I'm pretty sure I spent about 15 minutes just looking at all the fun little touches that she put everywhere.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend if you want Austin the way that Austin was meant to be had. I will, without doubt, be staying there again.",
