  "text": "Fiona's house is clean, spacious, cozy and in a quaint East Austin neighborhood near the east 6th street strip of restaurants, food trucks, shops and bars.  The cottage is also really close to the river if you're looking to walk or bike along the tree-lined trail. She's a great host and has plenty of recommendations for what to do in town.",
