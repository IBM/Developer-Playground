  "text": "Perfect spot.  We came in on a Friday and everything was as she promised. The cabin is small but perfect. It was clean and in the perfect spot for everything.  2 minutes to downtown. And walking distance to ALL the east 6th street bars and restaurants.  I would totally recommend staying here to anyone. Austin is a funky place and this cabin fits in perfectly!!",
