  "text": "We were in town for a BMX contest. This place was great! It was in the perfect location--close to downtown, famous food trucks, running trails along the river. It was small but comfortable and so cool. Renting bikes would be a fantastic way to get around. Its in a great, quiet neighborhood. Fiona made this place glow! Thanks for the great experience, Fiona.",
