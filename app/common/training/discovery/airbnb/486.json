  "text": "Fiona was such an amazing host - great communication before and during our stay + lots of awesome recommendations. We stayed here for F1 and couldn't have picked a better location - there was a bus stop at the end of the street that took us straight downtown - SUPER convenient. Lots of great bars within walking distance (Weather Up, Whisler's, etc.) and an amazing po'boy spot only one block away. Though the house is technically a \"studio\", the layout made it feel like there were several small rooms. We didn't use the kitchen but it was well-equipped and had lots of counter space. Hope to return to Austin soon and would definitely stay here again!",
