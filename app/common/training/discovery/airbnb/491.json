  "text": "I would highly recommend Fiona's place.  The apt is really cute and has everything you need.  The kitchen is well equipped and the bed is very comfortable.  The location is really convenient and a short bike ride away from downtown.  There are a couple of great taco places nearby.  Fiona was extremely helpful whenever we needed anything!",
