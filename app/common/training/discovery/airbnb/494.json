  "text": "This studio was just that - sweet and sexy! Everything was clean and ready for our arrival. Fiona did a great job communicating with us throughout the trip. The location is great too! We walked to 6th street with no problems and it is only a short drive/bike ride from downtown. And -- $1 breakfast tacos down the street!! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to anyone visiting Austin!",
