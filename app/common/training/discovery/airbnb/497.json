  "text": "Depends on what you're looking for when you come to Austin, but if you want to stay in a place with lot's of character that's clean and quite and near the river you really can't beat Fiona's spot. She was very friendly and helpful. You can't argue with the price for such a cool spot. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Austin. Also her place is near public transpo and it was easy to call a cab. Do yourself a favor and check out this spot.",
