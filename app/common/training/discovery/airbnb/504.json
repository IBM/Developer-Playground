  "text": "The cottage was really great for my weekend in Austin. Great part of town and a easy walk to some great spots on the East side and an easy bike ride to most anywhere in Austin.\n\nCheck in was super easy and convenient, the cottage is a cute space with every amenity one would need, and has a great front porch to hang if weather permits.\n\nIt was plenty of room for just me and would be perfect for a couple to getaway for a weekend to an epic city in a fun part of town. Many thanks to Fiona for accommodating me!",
