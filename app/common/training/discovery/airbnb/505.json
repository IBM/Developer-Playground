  "text": "Fiona's studio was absolutely fantastic in every way. The location was exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for - close to many of Austin's hot spots yet private, comfortable and homey. We rented bikes and cruised down the streets of her cool neighborhood to get to Rainey St, where we enjoyed several adult beverages and had an easy trip back to the studio. Great coffee houses and breakfast taco joints nearby as well. The cottage itself was clean and welcoming, with beer in the fridge and wonderful ornate details throughout. Fiona is kind, quick to respond to any messages, and made sure she could accommodate our schedule. We would (and will) recommend this studio to all of our friends that visit Austin.",
