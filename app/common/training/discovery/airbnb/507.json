  "text": "We loved our stay at Fiona's place over the Labor Day weekend!  We found that access to this home from the airport was super easy and the location is close to the downtown area.  Fiona had everything ready for us upon arrival, including beer in the fridge!  The place is very artsy in feel, which is perfectly suited to the artsy vibe of the city and adds a special flavor to the whole experience.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!",
