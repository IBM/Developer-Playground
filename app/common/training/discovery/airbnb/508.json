  "text": "Fiona was a superb host, excellent communicator and very accommodating to my check-in and our requests. She also gives great hugs! The studio is of a 4 star hotel standard, very spacious, gorgeously decorated, immaculately clean and in the best part of Austin-town. Plenty of good food and drink options nearby and Fiona is more than happy to give you a list as long as your arm of places to visit so take advantage of her old-school Austin savviness. She even gave me some excellent tattoo advice.",
