  "text": "Such a cute studio apartment conveniently located in East Austin. Very artistic, clean and comfortable. Fiona was a fantastic hostess. Fiona had a ton of restaurant and bar reccomendations (all we tried were great).We asked for a swimming hole and she pointed out one of the coolest spots I have been to (Krause Springs) and handed us a beach bag with towels and sunscreen for the trip.",
