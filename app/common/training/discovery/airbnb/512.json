  "text": "This stay was my first experience with Airbnb.  I was very excited about testing out an alternative to a hotel/motel stay.  I could tell by the information that the studio was very artsy and that made the location sound interesting.  We arrived late and went to dinner before checking in to the studio.  Once we arrived we searched for light switches and found a cockroach on the kitchen counter.  Naturally he scurried away so we moved some items on the counter to find three roaches.  We squished each of them with a shoe.  We did not have any experience with these critters so we did some research.  Turns out they can live for some time (days) once they have lost body parts so we flushed them down the toilet.  Also, they come into houses in the search for water.  Every time we used a shower or sink we patted them dry and closed the drain.   Before the end of our trip we spotted another roach and it got away.  Must say it was hard to sleep not knowing how many of them were in the house.  Once we locked the place up for the last time, I notified the owner of our departure and the roach problem.  She made it clear she was aware of the issue and was doing to have to pick another method for removing the roaches.  This is not what I wanted to hear.  Granted, I appreciate the honesty.  I just would have hoped she wouldnâ€™t rent the place unless the issue was fixed.  Overall disappointment due to lack of sleep.",
