  "text": "Fiona was a great hostess and contacted me immediately upon receiving my booking request.  She provided helpful information about things to see and do in Austin as well as information about road closures resulting from the Formula 1 event that was in town that weekend.  Fiona made sure we had the wifi password before we arrived and also made it easy to check-in and out especially given that our inbound flight arrived late and our outbound flight was early in the morning.  The studio is a perfect for 2 people.  It's even more spacious than we anticipated.  It was clean and comfortable with ample street parking.  Though we didn't have much opportunity to use it, the kitchen was well-equipped.  Overall, a very pleasant experience and one of our favorite Air BnB locations in Austin!",
