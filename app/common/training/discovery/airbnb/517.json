  "text": "This sweet little \"in-law\" is perfectly located in a great part of the city. The decor is whimsically inviting and colorful. We stayed during a cold snap, and extra heating options were in place. The wifi was out for a couple of days, caused by some severe weather- not Fiona's fault. Location, location, location. This place has it! What a fun stay, and thanks for the beer in the fridge, Fiona! We had a wonderful stay, and hope to come back someday.",
