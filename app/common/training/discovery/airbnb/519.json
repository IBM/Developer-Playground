  "text": "The cottage was cute and artsy as described. The neighborhood was quiet but also a bit odd. It was a pretty convenient 10 minute walk to 6th street.  There were a lot of beautiful houses and a lot of really dilapidated houses in the area. Also, there were a large amount of homeless people on our walk to/from 6th street. The house could have been more clean. The shower curtain had black mold/mildew growing on it and the bathroom had a lot of leftover shampoo bottles, etc. (I'm assuming from previous guests). The tub area just wasn't clean but the rest of the house was very tidy. Also, it was pretty cold during our stay and the heating situation in the house was pretty poor. Fiona did leave a space heater on for us for our arrival which really helped. It was unseasonably cold so I don't think the temp would normally have been an issue.",
