  "text": "First time to use airbnb and what a pleasant nice change of pace.  We were getting tired of stale generic hotels all over the country that lack character, charm and a local attitude without having to empty the bank account.  The cottage we were lucky enough to find in East ATX was everything you see in the pictures except that bed no longer has a white iron head and base board but more modern platform type frame now.  We got to try out some new local craft beers (awesome – Austin Beerworks) that were left in the fridge.  Everything we needed was available from wine glasses to the basic kitchen stuff you might need.  Fiona was a gracious host and gave us a ton of choices for eating and “doing Austin”….was available in a good way but not like hovering which was great.  Can’t say enough about the other folks review of making the short walk down the corner (maybe 1-2 blocks) to Las Cazuelas for amazing breakfast $1.00 tacos with a nice varied salsa bar.  Street parking was no issue but this is East Austin and not some high fancy suburban neighborhood with lots of character and crazy close to downtown and 6th street.  Took Uber (which picked us up in 5 minutes – wow fast) to see a show at the Belmont which was under $13.00 so great deal all the way around.  Would definitely stay again as this was less expensive, cooler, more Austin odd like in a good way, convenient and the way to stay in Austin.",
