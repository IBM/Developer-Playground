  "text": "We loved the privacy of Fiona's little bungalow.  It was cozy and perfect for a night or extended stay in Austin, thanks to the kitchen area.  My husband and I have already discussed this as being our go-to spot next time we're in Austin.  We got a cab back to the studio from 6th St. and paid under $10.   \r\n\r\nFiona was able to tell us more about the spot we had planned to visit for dinner which was quite helpful.  In the morning, we saw her leaving while on our way out.  She said it was no problem for us to get breakfast and come back to the space (it was before 10 a.m.)  Although we didn't return, it was nice to have the option.  Highly recommend this location!",
