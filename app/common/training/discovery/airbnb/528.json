  "text": "The location was perfect.  There is a Mexican restaurant in walking distance and it is a safe neighborhood to walk about in (per multiple uber drivers).  The cab fare to sixth street was only $5. \n\nHowever, like the other reviews,  it is dirty.  Upon arrival, there was hair in the tub, used bar soap, toothpaste, and watered down liquid soap.  The blinds and window baseboards were covered in dust.  \n\nIn our weekend we also found three cockroaches and multiple bugs.  One crawled into the suitcase and since there was no bug spray the owners trapped the bug for us.  Their excuse was that it was an \"old house in Texas\". We didn't shower.\n\nFiona and Brian were really nice and hospitable.  We wanted to stay at an air b&b to feel more comfortable than in a hotel but we just didn't feel that way.",
