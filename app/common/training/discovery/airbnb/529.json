  "text": "My friend and I were visiting Austin for a girl's weekend and Fiona's cottage was great overall. The location was in hip East Austin (might be too gritty for some but we loved it) with great bars and breakfast spots within blocks. There was also a bike shop within walking distance where we rented bikes. \r\n\r\nThe place itself was spacious, had a comfortable bed, and nice neighbors. Sheets and towels provided were clean, however a few spots could have used a wipe down. If you're used to 4 star pristine hotels, this probably isn't the place for you.\r\n\r\nFiona was super easy to communicate with and provided a great list of suggestions. We had a great time and truly enjoyed our stay!",
