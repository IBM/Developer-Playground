  "text": "Fiona was very responsive, friendly and helpful. We exchanged several emails to coordinate picking up house keys and check in, check out time. She also provided great tips on local restaurants and places of interest. \n\nHer place was really unique and cozy. I didn't mind that the bathroom didn't have a door (it had a thick curtain), and the bed was super comfortable. She has an A/C unit and ceiling fans so we stayed cool indoors in the otherwise hot and humid Austin summer. Lots of great bars and food trucks all within a 10 minute walk and really easy to call an Uber so you don't even need a car to stay here.",
