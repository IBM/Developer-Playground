  "text": "Fiona greeted us upon our arrival and happily provided us with several suggestions for exploring Austin as it was our first time.  The cottage was just as described - perfectly suited for my wife and I. We loved the location in East Austin - a 15 minute walk to Ravine Street and very close to the running/hiking trails. Would highly recommend!",
