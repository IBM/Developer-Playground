  "text": "We had a fantastic weekend in Austin! Location of the cottage was ideal for seeing the real side of Austin, it was clean, cosy and very comfortable. Nearly every place we ate, drank and visited Fiona had recommended and they did not disappoint. Would definitely recommend this spot for a stay in Austin!",
