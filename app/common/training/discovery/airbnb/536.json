  "text": "Fiona was extremely helpful leading up to my stay. I reserved the cottage on short notice (within a day of my arrival), but she was prepared to give me the lay of the land. I took her up on some of her suggestions, and went where the locals go. Good times!\r\n\r\nThe studio is as described, but I really only used it to sleep and shower. The night was quiet, the bed was comfortable, and the shower was hot. I was bid farewell by a kitten upon my departure. \r\n\r\nI'll look for her listing next time I'm in Austin!",
