  "text": "Our stay at Fiona's cottage was absolutely perfect! I fell in love with the purple cottage, the multi-colored walls, the gorgeous bathroom with beautiful light and pebble floors. Its a perfect sized studio and was cozy and artsy and perfect for my boyfriend and I's weekend getaway. There's also a little front porch area with a table and a chair, perfect for reading outdoors. I would honestly love to live there if I lived in Austin, it's that great!",
