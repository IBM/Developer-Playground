  "text": "Fiona's place was the perfect stay. The house was separate and cozy, with beautiful art decorating the walls. Fiona was very accommodating and a wonderful host. The house is close to much of the great food and fun in the area. The location made it very easy to move around. Fiona also gave us a long list of recommendations that were some of the best parts of our trip. We loved it and would recommend it to all.",
