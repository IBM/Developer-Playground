  "text": "As previous reviewers said. Great little place in Austin. Having a fridge and kitchen was a great benefit over a hotel. If you are a neat freak it's not for you. I had no issues and would stay there again. Super hot water and enough of it. Host was super accommodating and was able to get me in early and on really short notice. Neighborhood is upcoming but not fully there yet. You aren't around a lot of amenities but that makes it quiet too. Use uber and it will cost you 5-6 bucks to get to the touristy stuff.",
