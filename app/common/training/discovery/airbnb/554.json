  "text": "Staying in Fiona's cottage was wonderful. The cottage itself is perfect and has so much personality. Fiona provides recommendations for everything, from an incredible place to have brunch to a guide to local events. We felt like we got to see the real \"weird Austin\" because we weren't holed up in a standard hotel in downtown Austin. There is a small market & breakfast taco spot within walking distance where we got snacks & anything we needed for the stay. An uber downtown was around $6, and we did the whole stay without a car from Fiona's place. Thanks for everything and we would love to stay here again next time we are in Austin.",
