  "text": "Incredible house 2 blocks from Rainey street. This is the only place I've stayed in on airbnb that is actually nicer than the photos. The house is brand new as is everything in it. Comfy beds and bathrooms. Great private outdoor space.\nKevin is very helpful should you need anything. When I come back to Austin, no other place I would stay. This house is a no brainer",
