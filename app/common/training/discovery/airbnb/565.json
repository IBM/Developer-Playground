  "text": "I booked the Modern Farmhouse for three colleagues and myself to stay in when our distributed team met in Austin. The house is beautiful, clean, and comfortable; it's also in a great location, easily walkable to lots of great places in East Austin (and Rainey Street).\r\n\r\nFor corporate groups, I'd recommend considering the house a 3 bedroom/3 bathroom, as the sleeping loft doesn't have its own door, and requires walking down two flights of stairs to the first floor hall bathroom. For families or groups of friends, the sleeping loft is a great space, though! The bedrooms and bathrooms are all gorgeous.\r\n\r\nKevin was easy to communicate with, and we had a great stay.",
