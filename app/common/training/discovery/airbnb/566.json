  "text": "Nice home. Convenient to walking to Rainey Street, and just a short drive to the airport. Slept 8 comfortably. We would definitely come back. Kevin was friendly and a nice gift bag was waiting for us with some nuts and bbq seasonings.\r\n\r\nNo fault of the host, but this part of Austin has terrible tasting water and poor water pressure. Definitely pick up some bottled water, downstairs shower was much better than 2nd floor.",
