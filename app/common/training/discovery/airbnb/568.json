  "text": "Kevin made us feel incredibly welcome. Not only is his home gorgeous but it was well stocked with linens + little extras like shampoo and soap. When we had questions about anything he got back to us immediately. The backyard was lovely for hanging out in, and the WiFi even reached out there meaning we could do work with a cup of coffee in the morning while enjoying the weather. \r\n\r\nFor context: we were a group of 7 coworkers and never felt cramped. The air mattress that was provided was also one of the fanciest I have ever seen! I would highly recommend this home for a group or family.",
