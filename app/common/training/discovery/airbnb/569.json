  "text": "Kevin and his place were great!  We called on arrival and he was quick to answer and help us out.  The place itself was awesome--a great space with a relaxed feeling and great outdoor area to take in the Austin weather.  The house is also walkable to Rainy St with tons of great restaurants and nightlife. Everything else in downtown is just a few minutes away!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to meet up with a group in Austin!",
