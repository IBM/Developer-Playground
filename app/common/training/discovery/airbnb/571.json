  "text": "This place was gorgeous!! Lots of space, close to the action of the East Side, and Kevin was a great host. He was flexible with the check in & checkout times since no one was there prior to / after our visit. Also, the house was fully stocked -- beautiful grill, lots of dishes, towels, toiletries.. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly, and would love to stay here on our next Austin visit!",
