  "text": "Wonderful experience and stay.  The house is actually larger than it looks in the pictures, we had 11 guests and felt comfortable in the space.  The outdoor area was also perfect for entertaining - not pictured in the photos online was a bbq grill which came in handy over the course of the weekend.  The place was clean, well stocked with toiletries etc. and Kevin was also able to provide us with some airbeds.  I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Kevin but he was very responsive over text / e-mail which was perfect.  House is in close proximity (5-10 min walk) to Rainey Street which is full of restaurants and bars.  Overall, great experience and would definitely recommend it for larger groups.",
