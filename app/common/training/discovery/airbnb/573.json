  "text": "I really liked this home and it was a treat to stay there. It was clean and well appointed, and Kevin and Laura were a delight. She really went the extra mile for us in receiving packages before our arrival. \r\n\r\nAs for the neighborhood, I booked this house thinking our employees could walk to the convention center, but found myself taking Uber every time. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the early morning construction across the street. I would not hesitate to stay here again and will likely before the end of the year. It was a great place for our team of conventioneers to bond as a team. \r\n\r\nHuge thanks to Kevin and Laura for taking the effort to make our stay outstanding. :-)",
