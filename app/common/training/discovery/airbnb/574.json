  "text": "Wow, what a beautiful and open space! The house is centrally located off the 35 and close to downtown as well as the super fun east side. It has a large outdoor area, perfect for mellow wine nights but the bedrooms and Fatboy bean bags are so comfy that it's hard to wake up from afternoon naps. Communicating with Kevin was super easy. Would love to entertain at this property again.",
