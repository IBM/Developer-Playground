  "text": "The description was accurate, the house was easy to find and out of the way in a nice residential area. The hose has a pretty puppy who is concerned about protecting his mama, but this was only a mild distraction and not a concern at all. The pup didn't make any noise at bed time, and was genuinely just looking out for Martha. Cute. \r\nThe sleeping arrangement was simple - a comfy futon in a relatively empty room. Not the Ritz-Carlton, but perfect for someone who just needed to crash for the evening or a couple of days. And Martha had a great personality and seems well suited to hosting guests!",
