  "text": "Martha was a friendly host who made me feel welcome in her home. She was fine with my odd hours (very late arrival and out half the night the other days I was there). The accommodations were basic but comfortable. The location on Austin's east side was a convenient drive from the airport as well as the music festival I attended. Overall, a nice place to stay!",
