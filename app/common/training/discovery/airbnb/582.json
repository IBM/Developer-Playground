  "text": "Martha generously offered her place to me on extremely short notice (3 hours before arrival) when I was in a pinch.  I appreciated her willingness to get ready for my arrival after a long work day!  The place was good value, and I really enjoyed hanging/talking with Martha.  She has a rescue dog that was very frightened of me and protective (but not aggressive) of the house.  He eventually warmed up to me and it was no problem.  If you're frightened of dogs though I'd recommend finding a different spot.",
