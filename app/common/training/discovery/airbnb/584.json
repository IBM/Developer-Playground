  "text": "Staying with Martha was great! Her place is very easily accessible by car, and pretty central (a fifteen minute drive to most areas).  The futon is very comfortable, and she provided cozy blankets and nice towels.  Martha offered use of her kitchen, though we didn't take her up on it, except for putting a few things in the fridge.  Her cat is very adorable and friendly!  We chatted with Martha a few times when our paths crossed, and she gave us a bunch of awesome restaurant recommendations.  All in all a very hospitable host and a nice place to stay.",
