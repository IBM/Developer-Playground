  "text": "Great condo just a short 10 minutes from town. Condo is super quiet with tall ceilings (no one above you), very nice kitchen, large bedroom, very comfortable mattress. Spotlessly clean. Was great to have some breakfast items and coffee to start my day (and a great space to spend many hours working unfortunately for me). \r\n\r\nCheck in and communication was easy, Sally made sure all was good with the stay.\r\n\r\nOnly negatives might be that there isn't a walkable cool neighborhood close, you need to drive but that's ok.\r\n\r\nWhy stay in a hotel when you have your own entire nice place like this?",
