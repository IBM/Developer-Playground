  "text": "We could not have had a better experience. Chelsea was wonderfully easy to communicate with, check in/check out were stress-free. Everything in the house was as pictured/described or better. Comfy bedding, soft towels, everything was clean, plenty of toiletries and extras. She also went the extra mile and stocked the house with snacks and drinks which was such an awesomely kind thing to do. The bike provided came in super handy and had double locks for safety. The location was fantastic and there really was not a single negative! We very much enjoyed unwinding on the front porch just watching the rain after the long days and nights of SXSW. Would absolutely stay here again.",
