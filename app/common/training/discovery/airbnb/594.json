  "text": "This listing was even better than the first time I looked at it because the pictures were updated. Mostly modern feel but in a vintage home. It was a fantastic location for us as it was near the UT campus (we were there for graduation) as well as close to downtown. This home was perfect for hosting a post graduation get together. We had the roomy front porch as well as living room and kitchen areas for visiting. Chelsea provided us w/a card table and chairs for the extra invitees. The beds were quite comfortable and the towels were soft. Chelsea even had a great vase in which to put my sunflowers! I would stay here again! Oh, and great places to eat or have a drink within walking distance!",
