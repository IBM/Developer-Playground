  "text": "This is a wonderful house that feels bigger inside that it looks in the photos! The hosts are friendly and responded to all of our questions quickly via text message, and they made our check-in and check-out easy and painless. The house was absolutely spotless clean when we checked in, and there was plenty of convenient street parking in front so we didn't even use the back parking area. We had 5 total guests, and we never felt crowded or that we didn't have enough space in this house. The living room was a very comfortable central place for us to spend time together, and the front porch was a great place for us to sit and relax after coming home each day. The neighborhood is relatively quiet considering how close it is to downtown - I sleep with earplugs at home and didn't need to use them here, and the loudest sounds I heard were doves singing during the day and crickets chirping outside at night. I was out in the front yard on the phone until 2:00 a.m. or later a few nights, and the neighborhood seemed so peaceful considering how close and convenient it is to downtown. My hometown of Phoenix is not really walkable, and this neighborhood had so many things for us to do within easy walking distance! We walked to a record store, coffee shops, food trucks, high-end barbecue, patio bars and restaurants, and all of them were within 10-15 minutes walking distance. Between the close proximity of so much stuff to do and how nice the house felt when we were at home, I would recommend this house to anyone wanting a complete East Austin experience and will check with Chelsea first on this house's availability whenever I come back to Austin! :)",
