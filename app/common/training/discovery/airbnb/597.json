  "text": "This house could not be located better - it's a short walk across the train tracks to fun restaurants, bars and food truck lots on the east side. Rainey Street, downtown, Capitol building and the six street bars are also easily walkable. The house looks even better than the pictures. I really appreciated the front porch and the big bedrooms and how clean everything was.   The bathroom is stocked with plenty of towels and extra toilet paper.  The house itself is gorgeous and on a safe street.  The house is rather new with a security system it made us feel safe.",
