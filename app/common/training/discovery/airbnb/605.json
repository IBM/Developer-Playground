  "text": "I booked this house for my friends and I for a bachelorette party. This house was perfect! Great location and easy to get a quick Uber or Taxi to downtown (6th St). The neighborhood is nice and quiet, so we felt safe! We even walked to Rainey St. during the day on Sunday (15 minute walk).\r\n\r\nThe house was the perfect size for the 8 of us (we had 2 people on the pull-out couch).\r\n\r\nChelsea left her contact and wifi info in an easy to find place. Chelsea was very quick and attentive to my emails and texts. We all enjoyed our stay and would definitely look into renting the house again.",
