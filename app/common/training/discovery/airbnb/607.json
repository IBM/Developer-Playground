  "text": "Chelsea's home is beautiful, better than the pictures. The furniture, fixtures, etc. are all very new, clean, and comfortable. It's a cozy size but comfortable for 6+ people. Though we did not meet Chelsea, it was easy to access the keys and she was helpful and responsive via text. Thank you for welcoming us into your home!",
