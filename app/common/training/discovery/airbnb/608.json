  "text": "Our stay in Austin for ACL was awesome thanks to Chelsea. The house and location were perfect, we had 6 people and had plenty of space for us all to spread out. Chelsea made the check in easy with detailed instructions and even left us some beer in the fridge as a welcome. The location of the place was great, within walking distance to Rainey St and some of the 6th st bars but a short Uber to everything. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay!",
