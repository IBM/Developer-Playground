  "text": "This home is amazing! If you are staying in Austin, I highly recommend this home.  Great location, 10 minute walk to downtown/6th street, and plenty of private parking.  The host made us feel right at home.  The 3 bedrooms are very roomy and very clean.  The living room is very large and has plenty of seating. We booked this home for Austin City Limits and it was perfect!!",
