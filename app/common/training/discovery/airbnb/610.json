  "text": "The description of the house was accurate.  It had great amenities and was comfortable.  The house was very clean.  The neighborhood is conveniently located within walking distance to many downtown sites.  We were presently surprised at the number of local spots hidden in East Austin, all within 10 minutes walk.  The immediate area did have a number of rundown houses mixed in with newer and well maintained residences.  I would be slightly concerned walking alone in the evening, especially as you walk east.  Despite parts of the neighborhood being in disrepair, I would definitely stay here again.  Additionally, I have limited knowledge of Austin neighborhoods so don't have much to compare it too.",
