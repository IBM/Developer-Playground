  "text": "I stayed at Joep and Courtney's Austin home in August and was thrilled with the spotless accommodations. The room was large and private with a comfortable bed and a good sized bathroom. The best feature was the deck which overlooked the back yard garden. The kitchen has a sunny alcove which was the perfect place to enjoy coffee in the morning and peek at the yards of neighboring homes.  \r\nThe location is amazing if you're interested in the local music scene, touring Austin's museums and finding unique places to eat out. it was a memorable experience thanks to the gracious hosts.",
