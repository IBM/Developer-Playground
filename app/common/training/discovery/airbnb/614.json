  "text": "Courtney and Joep were delightful!  The accommodations were very clean, neat, comfortable and private. Communication was great.  We had a wonderful experience and felt like we'd made 2 new friends when we left. We enjoyed coffee in the morning in their cute, bright breakfast nook, and enjoyed looking out into the pretty back yard with the veggie and herb garden. Their home is in a cool, eclectic neighborhood. They were great about recommending different places to eat and see in Austin. We had the best time ever!!",
