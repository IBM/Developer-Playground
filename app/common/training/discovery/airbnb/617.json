  "text": "Joep and Courtney are lovely people with a clean, bright home. They were very friendly and hospitable, and went out of their way to make lists of area restaurants for me, along with and other nice touches. Reasonably priced morning yoga sessions with Courtney were much appreciated. Their home is a very inviting place to stay, especially if you're into eco stuff because they're very conservation-oriented and Joep is an environmental consultant.",
