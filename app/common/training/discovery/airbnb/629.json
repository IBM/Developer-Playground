  "text": "Staying with Joep and Courtney was such a pleasure. They were incredibly hospitable and informative and they were fantastic with our 15 month old daughter. Their home is lovely and the guest bedroom and bathroom were very comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Austin which had a lot to do with Joep and Courtney. We couldn't recommend this place enough.",
