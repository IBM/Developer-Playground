  "text": "We had a lovely stay with Joep and Courtney. They welcomed us into their home and were great company, offering many local tips on what to see and do. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. Our time in Austin was much more memorable because of Joep and Courtney. We are so glad we had the opportunity to meet such kind and gracious people during our travels. Thankyou",
