  "text": "Our stay with Joep & Courtney was due to a wedding being held nearby & reception at the Barr Mansion. The location was the perfect distance between the two.  Because  of our schedule we used the place as a crash pad after a full day of events. Thanks to our hosts for everything! The space was delightful, clean, and the hosts were very engaging.  Our only problem was in the 104 degree heat of Austin, the air conditioner left the house on the warm side.",
