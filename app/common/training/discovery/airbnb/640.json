  "text": "Staying with Joep and Courtney turned out be just perfect for our SXSW week. Although we did not see much of our hosts (us being on the \"night\" schedule while they kept on with their normal hours ...), we always felt that we are being cared for. The room was private, suitably furnished and with its own private bathroom just across the hall. I especially enjoyed the backyard, where I took measure of the sun each morning for a few minutes. When we did talk, we found the Meijers interesting and challenging (in the good sense ...). The location itself was close to the city (15min driving on most days) but yet quite and removed from traffic. I would recommend their place for anyone considering a stay in the Austin area.",
