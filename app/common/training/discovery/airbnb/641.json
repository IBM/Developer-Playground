  "text": "I stayed with Courtney and Joep on my first trip to Austin (and my first airbnb experience). They have a beautiful house, and the accommodations were very clean and comfortable. Courtney and Joep were kind enough to invite me to have a couple dinners with them, and they provided breakfast as well. In addition, they were both welcoming, very interesting, and a lot of fun to talk to. I would highly recommend Courtney and Joep to anyone looking for a place to stay in Austin. They exceeded all my expectations!",
