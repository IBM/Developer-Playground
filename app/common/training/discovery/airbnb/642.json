  "text": "This is actually the second time I have had the opportunity to stay with Courtney and Joep.   I enjoy their company, their house is located in a quiet neighborhood that is close to major roads, but not too close that a person hears traffic.  Courtney and Joep are more than willing to give suggestions as to where to go for dining or activities.  They are flexible with check in and out times and that was helpful with my schedule while I was in town. \r\nThe best thing about their place is the hosts.  I am able to have intelligent conversations with them over meals and I leave their home with more knowledge.  I also respect and very much enjoy all the ways they have implemented an envioronmental conscientious livestyle.  They are sweet people and I plan on staying with them again next time I am in Austin.",
