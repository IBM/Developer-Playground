  "text": "Our hosts couldn't have been more accomodating! Courtney and Joep were always willing to help with directions or recommending restaurants, etc. We stayed there during SXSW so it was nice to get out of the busy city to their quiet home. The house was clean, safe and simply furnished. The bed was comfy and the bread Joep made was delicious! We had some great conversations and had a fun time practicing yoga in the living room together. I wouldn't hesitate to contact them again for another visit or to recommend them to a friend.",
