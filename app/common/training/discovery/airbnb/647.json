  "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Austin for MotoGP and to explore this new-for-us city.  We stayed with Joep and Courtney for four nights and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.  The location is great, right near the 35, yet private and quiet in a pretty neighborhood.  The best thing about this place, however, are the hosts.  Joep and Courtney are warm, \"green\" minded people and are full of helpful information about where to go and what to do.  They had delicious home made bread and nut butters available in the morning which we would enjoy before heading out on our adventures.  I didn't bring enough warm clothing (the weather was cooler than I had anticipated) and Courtney let me borrow a top so I didn't have to buy one.  A great experience all around, we will definitely stay with them again if we visit Austin!",
