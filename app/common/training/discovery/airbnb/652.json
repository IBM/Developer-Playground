  "text": "Joep and Courtney are engaging and accommodating hosts.  The room is basic, but clean, convenient and comfortable.  The house is located in a residential neighborhood.  They make great homemade bread.  If you want milk with your coffee, you'd  be best to let them know in advance.  (I like my coffee black, and it was good!)  If you get a chance to talk with them, you will find that they are articulate, informed and interesting.",
