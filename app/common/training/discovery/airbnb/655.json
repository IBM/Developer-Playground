  "text": "Joep and Courtney were wonderful hosts, friendly and most accomodating!  Yummy coffee and homemade bread were available each morning, along with friendly conversation.  We so enjoyed the added bonus of getting to know Joep's sweet parents, visiting from The Netherlands. We left feeling that we had new friends, and hope to see them all again someday.  Thank you so very much, Courtney and Joep!",
