  "text": "I enjoyed staying with Courtney and Joep. They made me feel part of the family. Their house is in a quiet and safe part of town and the room I slept in was clean and the bed comfortable. The plumbing in the bathroom is a bit quirky but easy to master. It is advisable to have a car when staying in this part of north Austin: the house is about a mile from the nearest bus stop and it takes over an hour to get downtown by public transport.",
