  "text": "Our stay at Joep & Courtneys place was only a brief one (our choice!), but very agreeable nonetheless. Joep was very flexible and accommodating towards our check-in needs and a very warm & welcoming host. The house is located in a very nice and quiet part of town, and the room is very comfortable.\n\nBecause we wanted to see as much of Austin as we could in the limited time we had, we only spent a short time with Joep, but he gave us some very useful tips on restaurants (Hopdoddy's  is absolutely worth the visit) and place to go see.\n\nWhen we return to Austin we'll try and stay with Joep & Courtney again for sure!\n\nBedankt voor de geweldige gastvrijheid!",
