  "text": "My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay with Courtney and Joep.  They responded quickly to our reservation request, were very communicative before and after our arrival, and even spent a good deal of time talking with us and making us feel welcome.  Their house was clean and in a nice neighborhood.  We definitely recommend their place to anybody interested.  Not only did we have a safe, affordable, comfortable place to stay during our weekend trip, but we feel like we made two new friends, as well.  Thanks, Courtney and Joep!",
