  "text": "You can't get much better than the smell of fresh baked bread to welcome you into Courtney and Joep's home. For us it was a great location, less than 10 minutes from our son's place and with easy access to the sights and shopping in Austin -- that is once you get the hang of the frontage road access system for the interstate. We enjoyed conversations of common interest in gardening and environmentally conscious living. Our son is in Austin, so we'll be back and hope to be able to stay with them again. Thank you!",
