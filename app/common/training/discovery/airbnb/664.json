  "text": "Joep and Courtney are both very nice people. It felt like I was visiting someone I already knew. They were out for the evening visiting friends and I was able to get in some good reading and relax before my bicycle race early the next morning. I was a low maintenance guest but Courtney had plenty of options for anything someone might need. Their environmental friendly home is neat as well. Very clean bedroom with a comfortable bed. Your clean private bathroom is two steps across the hall. It is also only a short distance to the freeway and there was little to no noise from that direction during my stay. I was able to use a secondary driveway to park my vehicle and it was directly outside of my bedroom window. It was overall a great experience.",
