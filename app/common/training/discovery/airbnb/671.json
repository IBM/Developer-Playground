  "text": "We absolutely loved staying with Joep and Courtney. The house is wonderful, the bed is comfortable, everything was very clean and it really felt like home away from home. Courtney was excellent about communicating with us about details, and even though we were very busy she was able to accommodate our schedule. I would highly recommend staying with them, and will definitely stay here again if my travels take me their way.",
