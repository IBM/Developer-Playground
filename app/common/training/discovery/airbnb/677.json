  "text": "This was a great place that fit our needs while we were in Austin. Courtney and Joep were very accommodating to our late arrival and their flexible checkout time was also very nice for us. This location is approximately 20 minutes outside of Austin which was very nice for us due to our car being fully packed and being able to park it in their side driveway. We didn't have much interaction with Joep or Courtney but they were extremely responsive. \nThe room was very nice and was essentially a separate part of the house. As soon as you enter the house, you turn to your right and go down the stairs and your room/bathroom are right there. We enjoyed our time here and would recommend it to others.",
