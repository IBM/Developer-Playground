  "text": "Joep and Courtney were accommodating about our arrival time.  Joep greeted us at the door when we arrived and showed us the room.  The description matched our experience.  They also were flexible about our schedule throughout the weekend.  It was a pleasant quiet residential neighborhood, and easy to access both the freeway and local street network.  Although we had little overlapping time, the time that we did share with them was engaging.  We enjoyed having access to their kitchen and sunny breakfast room.",
