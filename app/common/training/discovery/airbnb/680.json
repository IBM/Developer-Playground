  "text": "Courtney and Joep were very hospitable, kept a clean home, and went out of their way to make my stay a memorable one. They offered great advice for things to do in Austin, and were kind enough to lend me their washing machine when I got low on clothes. Despite the stormy weather, I had a pleasant and welcoming stay. I will definitely look them up the next time I'm coming to town!",
