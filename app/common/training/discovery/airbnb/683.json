  "text": "Courtney and Joep's home was the ideal place to spend a weekend in Austin. It's a great place to come back to after an evening downtown. The neighborhood was cool and the house was nice, clean and colorful. We didn't cross paths during our stay but communication with Courtney and Joep was always prompt and helpful.",
