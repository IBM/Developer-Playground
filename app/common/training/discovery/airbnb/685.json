  "text": "Booked less than 2 weeks away from my trip and had a lot of questions that Joep and Courtney were able to help answer in a timely matter! We came during ACL and they were around in the early morning and was always kind, even provided some freshly baked bread and fruit as well as had bathroom amenities. Also had suggestions for local eateries and instructions for downtown parking when needed. It was definitely a nice stay. They're like the roommates you wish you had, courteous, helpful, respectful, and out of your hair! Was easy to get in and out of house and around neighborhood as well.",
