  "text": "Our stay at Courtney's and Joep house was wonderful, this is our second time staying in their home and we couldn't ask for a better place. They are great hosts, their home is clean and pleasant, very relaxing atmosphere.. The location of their house couldn't be better, close to downtown and many restaurants.. Courtney and Joep are very friendly and easy going and they truly make you feel welcome..I highly recommend their home for a wonderful experience.",
