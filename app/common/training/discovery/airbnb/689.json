  "text": "Lisa was great, never actually met her in person but she was very accessible via text message. Lisa provided snacks, water, and wifi. The room has its own access, bathroom and fridge. There is a beautiful yard and patio and we  were able to park in the driveway for the weekend as well. We were in town for ACL and were able to walk to the festival everyday which was great to save time and money on trying to find an uber or pedicab. We had a great stay and I would definitely recommend staying here if you are traveling to Austin!",
