  "text": "This is a fantastic, very private and comfortable and clean place. We only stayed for one night but hosts left us snacks and water. Comfy bed adn strong shower too. Their backyard is really neviable though we didn't get a chance to hang otu there much. The neighborhood is really nice!.  At once relaxing and lively with kids and people walking about, but you are walkable to south lamar, the park, south congress and Torchy's tacos. The hosts were great at communicating and really accommodating to our schedule. Can't wait to go back.",
