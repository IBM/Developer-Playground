  "text": "I can't say enough great things about this spot. Perfect if you are looking for a quiet, comfortable, relaxing place to rest your head during your trip, weather it be vacation or work oriented. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Blown away by the generous and welcoming hosts. They were genuinely concerned with making my stay as comfortable as possible. Great spot in a quiet little neighborhood. Lots of privacy but not far from things. \nHighly recommend.",
