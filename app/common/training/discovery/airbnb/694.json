  "text": "I had a really pleasant stay at Lisa's place. The room was warm, very welcoming, and had everything I wanted--it even had snacks! Very clean, the water pressure on the shower was strong, and the bed was quite comfortable. The neighborhood was very quiet and was an easy jog to Zilker Park and it was also very easy to get Lyfts or Ubers in order to jet off to another neighborhood. Lisa was extremely communicative and very helpful. I would highly recommend a stay here! Thank you, Lisa for facilitating a great stay in Austin!",
