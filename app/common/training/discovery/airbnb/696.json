  "text": "This was my first time using AirBNB (though have used a competitor) and we were extremely pleased with both the accommodations and our hostess Lisa. She made sure we knew how to get in and told us where we could find extra blankets and that there is air conditioning if need be. Both Lisa and her husband are very friendly and laid back which added to the experience. We were there just to explore Austin for 3 days before business and it was a great location. Near Zilker, Barton Springs and S. Lamar. We used Uber to get around and if we had been able to get a car rental the driveway would have been available to us. We can't recommended this rental and Lisa highly enough. Thanks for a great experience.",
