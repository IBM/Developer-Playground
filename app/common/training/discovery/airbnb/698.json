  "text": "As I sit drinking my coffee enjoying the sunshine on my last morning in Austin, I'm enjoying the beauty and uniqueness that surrounds me in Lisa's artsy, fun backyard,  My stay was great.  Lisa was amazingly accommodating, from providing a stocked fridge to meeting my unexpected needs (iPad charging cord, beach chair, sunscreen).  The room was perfect, private, had all I needed.  The area couldn't be better situated!  So much is within walking distance (S. Congress shopping, Zilker Park, Barton Springs, Zilker Botanical Garden).  It's hard to leave.",
