  "text": "Lisa was so welcoming and gracious.  The accommodation was everything she said it would be.  She had so many thoughtful touches that made the stay so enjoyable........ drinks and snacks and even breakfast food!  We could come and go easily and it was so relaxing, very peaceful and quiet.  A beautiful spot and 5 minutes from where I needed to be.  Thanks Lisa for a wonderful weekend.  Sabra",
