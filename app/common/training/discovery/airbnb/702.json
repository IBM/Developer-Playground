  "text": "Lisa's private apartment was absolutely perfect for our needs. The bed is very comfortable and the whole place provides privacy and we really enjoyed Lisa's eclectic style.  While we never met Lisa in person, she was communicative and very easy to work with.  Plus, Zilker is our favorite neighborhood and was within walking distance from most of our plans.  Would love to stay again!",
