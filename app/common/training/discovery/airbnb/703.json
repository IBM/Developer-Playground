  "text": "Lisa's place was excellent--very clean and stocked with everything we could need. It was quiet and had a great porch to eat breakfast on. Lisa was extremely helpful and a wonderful host. Although she was out of town, she made sure we were set up and made herself available in case we needed her. We would stay here again and recommend it to others! Thank you, Lisa!",
