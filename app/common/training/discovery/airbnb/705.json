  "text": "During my friend and my stay at Jon and Lydia's we were well taken care of. The room had a king size bed which was great, along with easy access to our own bathroom. Lydia provided us with bath and beach towels. Jon and Lydia are great hosts and their home is wonderful. It has an amazing deck/patio that overlooks the lake. Lydia had coffee ready for us in the morning and we loved the atmosphere they created. They brought us a paper from the local gas station that listed all the live music of the week. They also They also have two furry fun friends Colt and Zen who also made us feel welcomed! I would highly recommend that you stay at Lake Travis with Jon and Lydia. (P.S. Jon also gave me a recommendation for a place to get a run in - at Mansfield Park. It was a beautiful path along the lake!)",
