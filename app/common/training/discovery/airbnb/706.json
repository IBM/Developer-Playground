  "text": "This is the PERFECT getaway location! The house is very easy to get to, and the room itself is great with a very comfortable bed and refrigerator. The balcony overlooks the lake, and their private dock is a great place to take a swim, or just hang out. \r\n\r\nThey were perfect hosts - they took us out on the lake with their boat, let us know what to do in the area, but still gave us our space. I can definitely recommend staying here!",
