  "text": "We loved our stay at John and Lydia's! My boyfriend and I were visiting friends in Austin, and we picked Club Indigo as a home base for our trip. We had planned all sorts of adventures, but it was hard to tear ourselves away from the house. It's right on Lake Travis, and we loved sitting out on the deck with their dog, Colt, and walking down to the lake for a quick swim. There are some great coffee shops and restaurants nearby, and it's super easy to get into the city. We definitely hope to stay here again the next time we're in town!",
