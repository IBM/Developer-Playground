  "text": "Lydia and John were extremely welcoming to my girlfriend and I. We had an excellent time. The bedroom and restroom were clean and supplied for our stay. We spent most of our time on exploring the area and it was a great place to come back to. We would've liked to enjoy their patio and dock some more since they had a wonderful setting.",
