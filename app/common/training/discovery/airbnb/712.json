  "text": "This was the most wonderful experience!  Our Hostess Lydia and her husband are amazing and welcoming hosts. This was our first time using Airbnb and it was fantastic!  We recommend this beautiful place for a wonderful relaxing get away!  It was perfect for my husband and I to get away and celebrate my birthday with a relaxing home and wonderful dock by the lake and a deck to enjoy mornings and evenings on. Lydia even had a card and small cake for me on my birthday!  She made everything extra special! The room was just as explained and the home was exactly like the pictures.  We will definitely be going back!!",
