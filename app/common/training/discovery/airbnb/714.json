  "text": "Staying at Lydia and John's...words cannot do it justice.  The accommodations, the hospitality, the location, the hosts, the warm welcoming experience...priceless.  We traveled from afar to Austin to attend a wedding and were re-routed to Houston, only to find out there wouldn't be any more flights to Austin (can you say history- making, record-breaking flooding and lightening?!)  The debacle caused us to arrive at Lydia's late at night, many hours past our original arrival time.  And where was Lydia?  In her driveway, swaying a light, welcoming us home.  Home...that sums it up best.  Thank you, Lydia and John, we would stay with you again in a heartbeat.  Our only request is that the stay would be longer next time.",
