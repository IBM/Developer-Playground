  "text": "Is 6 stars an option? This home was everything we could hope for & more, so much I don't even know where to begin. From the start Cindy was more than helpful with communication & accommodating with every request. Upon arrival we were absolutely blown away by the beauty of the home & the surroundings. The picturesque setting was enough to leave all our friends & family in a serious state of awe from the pictures. I could go on about the design but that's obvious enough from the pictures. What really brought it all together was an amazing host in Cindy. From the little things to the big things, we could not have been luckier. A tasty home-cooked treat for breakfast. An umbrella to ward off the rain. A wrap for my sprained ankle. And on and on and on. Her generosity & hospitality are as amazing as the view. Icing on the cake: 3 goofball French bulldogs, aka my new best friends. \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend could not have loved everything any more than she did. It was a weekend in heaven for her, that's an amazing feeling to have. I WOULD recommend the Modern Hill Country Getaway to anyone & everyone (and believe me my friends have already asked) but on second thought, I'm only telling the people I trust to treat our new favorite home away from home right. I have a lot of friends in Austin, but if we ever visit again I feel like we will 100% try to visit Cindy in the hills again, as it truly is a one in a million experience.",
