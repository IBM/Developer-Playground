  "text": "Mat is a great guy. Extremely friendly and considerate. Ended up being an awesome friend, as well.\r\n\r\nThe house is nice, (a little dirty, but not a big deal). Location is great; 20 yards to the bus stop, walk half a block to a grocery store. \r\nThere are dogs next door that are loud, sometimes through the night.\r\n\r\nMat was always willing to pick up groceries and drive me places. Was interested in me as a person, which is something that isn't always there. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend staying with Mat. Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely give him a call first.",
