  "text": "I had a great time with Mathew at his house and with the housemates. The house was really nice, quite clean and tidy. Mathew was really involved in the shopping and preparing special meals for the holidays (halloween, thanksgiving, ...) even though he was not at that time! He also offered to pick me up and take me to the airport. It was a very pleasant stay. I have no doubt that I will contact him first If I come back to Austin.",
