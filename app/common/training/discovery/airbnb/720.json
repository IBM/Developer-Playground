  "text": "I totally recomend the house. I stayed in the 'large room' for one month. I slept very well every night there: the bed is good and the place is quiet. They borrowed me a bike and it makes my life easier. The kitchen is fully equipped and it's easy to cook at any time.. The house is close to the supermarket too.  Important: the people of the house are relax, friendly and trustworthy.",
