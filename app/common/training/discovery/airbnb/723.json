  "text": "Matt was able to accommodate my friend and I on short notice after we had a less than comfortable stay at a different location.  He was very welcoming and gave us a tour upon arrival and provided us each with our own key.  The location was a short drive away from South Congress, Rainey Street, and East Sixth, which is where we spent most of our time.  Although we did not interact much with Matt or his roommates, we felt very comfortable and his place was perfect for our needs!",
