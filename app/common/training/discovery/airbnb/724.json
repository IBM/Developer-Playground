  "text": "If you are travelling alone, so far this is a safe place ( though dark streets 12am). Good allowed use of the kitchen and some small items fridge space. Detachable showerhead- Bathroom is shared between 2 other Roomies then, I have no problems taking turns with available hair dryer for use. Queen size comfy bed~ clean --no smell.. Quiet neighborhood for a good nights sleep.\r\n2 Block walking distance to X-mobile store and XXX ~ the grocery store there. The bus-stop #17 is almost a walk right infront of the door step. #4 is a slight further but both brings you to downtown and #17 is near Hilton Austin for a short walk to the Austin Convention Center and the famous 6th Street strip to explore. I had the best time during Halloweens, Roomies biked to downtown because its not easy to find parking downtown then. Expensive. Explored the 6th street Halloween strip and Foodtrucks for foodies seeker.(Night Scene). Overall, expect staying at a homey environment where everyone is cool and friendly. Not with a concierge spick and span hotel. Good big sized room with a couch on the side and a dresser table and own closet space.",
