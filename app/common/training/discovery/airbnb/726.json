  "text": "Our stay with Mathew was very pleasurable. We never actually met him in person but we had no problem coordinating our check in and everything was prepared when we arrived. \r\n\r\nThe room was spacious and plenty big for the two of us. It would provide a comfortable stay for groups of 3 or 4 as well. \r\n\r\nThe location was great. It is no more than 5-10 minutes from most of the good night spots in Austin and within 20 minutes of pretty much anywhere in the metro area. It is also really close to some great mexican restaurants. \r\n\r\nWe would gladly stay with Mathew again and highly recommend his room.",
