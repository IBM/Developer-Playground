  "text": "Room looks exactly as it is in the picture. Perfect for a short stay. Mat and his roommates were awesome! Mat even stopped working to help us find a place to buy liquor (since markets can't sell it). Also let us know where to grab good local food. As a bonus, his girl made us dinner and we ended up playing a fun board game that night! Definitely recommend staying here. Very memorable.",
