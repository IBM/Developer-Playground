  "text": "We enjoyed our time at Mathew's home. The room was big, nicely furnished, exactly as pictured and the home is very well located for nearby shopping, easy access to I-35 and downtown Austin. While Mathew was out of town on business during our stay, his house mates were very friendly and helpful. The home has a very laid back feel about it. We would consider staying there again on a future trip to Austin. Thank you, David Carlton",
