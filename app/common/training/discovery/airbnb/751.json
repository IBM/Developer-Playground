  "text": "My girlfriend and I very much enjoyed this room in Matthew's home, which was exactly as advertised. The room was spacious and had two beds available (the bed was soft, yet comfortable), and was well-cooled with the air conditioning and ceiling fan.\r\n\r\nWes, Matthew's roommate, made us feel at home and helped us with the lock when we initially couldn't figure it out. Wish we could have met Matthew though!\r\n\r\nNote that it's not exactly walking distance to Dirty 6th St or downtown, but with an Uber, Car2Go, or a rental car everything is just a short drive away.",
