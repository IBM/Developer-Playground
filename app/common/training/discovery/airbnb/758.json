  "text": "I've stayed in airbnb's with friends abroad, so this is my first time doing it for myself, as well in the US. I hadn't been to Austin in a couple of years, and even then I hadn't done the city justice. \n\nMathew's home is cozy and perfect. We found everything as it was in his description and his home is very clean. My friends absolutely adore pets, so the cats and the chinchilla were an absolute delight. His roommates were really pleasant too. We all felt very comfortable.",
