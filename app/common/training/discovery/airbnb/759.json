  "text": "Matthew's place was in a great area. It's a really close drive to downtown and the university, so it wasn't a hassle stopping by the house going to and from different places in the city. It was very easy getting in and out of his house without disturbing anyone. It's only a few blocks from the bus stop, so it's a good place to stay if you're without a car. The room is comfortable and fit me and three others easily. I would definitely recommend staying here.",
