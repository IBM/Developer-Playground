  "text": "The room was great. The beds were comfortable, sheets and pillows all freshly cleaned, and the bathroom was super well stocked. I had my pick of shampoos and conditioners from four or five different brands, and face wash, clean toothbrushes, towels were all provided by the host. It was definitely all above and beyond my expectations. The house was also keyless entry via coded keypad which made coming and going extremely easy and seamless. On top of it all, Matt, our host, was super friendly, chill, and overall a great host. Excellent place to stay.",
