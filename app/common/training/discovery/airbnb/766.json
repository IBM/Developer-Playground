  "text": "We did not actually meet Matt, but he sent us all the info we needed to enter the house and our room. We found it easily and made ourselves at home. \r\n\r\nMatt has a very nice house in a nice neighborhood and our room was clean and spacious. We enjoyed our stay at Matt's place a lot. Also  in large part because Austin is a great city where we met some great people.\r\n\r\nWe did meet his roommate and his girlfriend, they were very friendly and helped us out with tips and beers :)",
