  "text": "Camille is a great hostess!  She extended every courtesy.  Her place was nice and clean and her dog is adorable and friendly.  The property has lots of trees and it is obvious she is intending to provide a warm and peaceful, relaxing stay.  I will check in with her again when I travel to Austin!",
