  "text": "Perfect little space while visiting Austin! Everything from the actual design of the house to the interior details are so well thought out and a pleasure to call home for a few days. Andrea and Roman were both so gracious in wanting to share about their home towns and gave us customized recommendations to local spots. The room is actually a separate wing of the main home and is totally private and it feels like your own secluded studio space. My only comment is that the loft bed does not have any guard to give a sense of security while sleeping on the loft.\r\n\r\nAll in all great spot to experience the east side of Austin!",
