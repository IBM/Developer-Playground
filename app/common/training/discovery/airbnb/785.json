  "text": "Roman and Andreas little \"studio\" is lovely. I've been looking for places to stay in Austin for a little and I found everything to be ugly besides this.\r\nCheckin was really easy as the keys were in a lock box. Very nice bathroom and comfortable bed. It sleeps two people very well.\r\n\r\nWhen ever I come back to Austin, I would totally try to stay with Roman and Andrea again.",
