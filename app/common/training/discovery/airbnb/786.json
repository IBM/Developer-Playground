  "text": "This place was awesomeeeeee!!! We loved every little detail of the studio, and the architecture of the house is really neat. The shower had hot water (which is what we needed the most on a cold day in Austin), there was a TV with movies, and wireless internet was fully working! Everything was super clean, and Roman & Andrea were super cute and friendly; they recommended yummy places to eat nearby :) Definitely coming back to stay for more days on our next trip to Austin.",
