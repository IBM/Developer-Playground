  "text": "My wife and I had a really nice weekend stay at Roman & Andrea's place.  They are super friendly hosts who made us feel welcome and well oriented in our first visit to Austin. Their place matched its Airbnb photos and description to a tee.  It's a cool, tasteful and modern design with careful details -- we loved staying there.  And the location is great.  You avoid the touristy hubbub of SOCO, and are super convenient to nightlife on East 6th, Rainey or downtown, as well as outdoor activities on the water.",
