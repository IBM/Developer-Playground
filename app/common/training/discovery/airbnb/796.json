  "text": "We stayed at Andrea and Roman's place for three nights. The place was excellent and completely as shown in the pictures. The room/apartment was very clean and everything was well arranged. Although it is advertised as a guest room, it was more like a private apartment due to the separating hall and separate entrance from there. Andrea and Roman were very uncomplicated and flexible, which made checking in and out like a breeze. Both of them were very helpful and we felt comfortable staying at their place. We would highly recommend staying at this place when going to Austin.",
