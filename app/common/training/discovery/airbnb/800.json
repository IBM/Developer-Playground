  "text": "I had a lovely weekend stay at Roman and Andrea's crash pad. It was clean, modern and very cool.  The location of their home makes it easy to get to downtown and the nightlife on the East side. There's also a CapMetro bus stop very close to their place.  \nAndrea and Roman are very friendly hosts and it all made my stay very enjoyable. I'd love to stay here again on my next visit to Austin.",
