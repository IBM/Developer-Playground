  "text": "Fantastic stay. Just like in the photos - unique cozy spot - very stylish. The location's perfect too - an enjoyable walk/bike away from E sixth's killer bars and restaurants. Roman and Andrea were friendly when we crossed paths - but the space feels like your own with its separate entrance.",
