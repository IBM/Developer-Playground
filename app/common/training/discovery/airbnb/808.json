  "text": "So glad we found this place! It has a stylish boutique feel (a la Liz Lambert) at a fraction of the cost. Great hosts, too, very responsive with any questions or suggestions. The neighborhood was nice, just a short walk from East Sixth (a highlight of our trip). Will hands-down recommend this spot to any friends that plan a visit to Austin.",
