  "text": "Roman and Andrea are fantastic hosts.  The were accommodating and friendly.  If there were an Austin's cutest couple award, they would probably win. \r\n\r\nThe room was private, clean and very comfortable.  They are also very conveniently located if you want to get downtown and enjoy downtown Austin.  It was an easy walk to the convention center as well for me every morning with plenty of options for breakfast on the way.  If I have to attend a conference in Austin again, this is where I will stay.",
