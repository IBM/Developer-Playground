  "text": "Comfortable and in a fun location, this was a great room for the price. I didn't have an opportunity to meet Andrea, but Roman was very friendly and made sure I had all the information needed prior to arriving. \r\nInitially had some reservations regarding how comfortable the sleeping area would be, but found the mattress to be reasonably comfortable and the loft area has enough headroom that I could move around only minimally hunched (I'm 5'10\"). Room also comes with a solid book collection.\r\n\r\nRoom is as advertised including fast WiFi!",
