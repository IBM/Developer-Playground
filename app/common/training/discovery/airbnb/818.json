  "text": "Nice spot in a cool neighbourhood.  Very close to the river for early morning runs.  Very excellent food (Mexican, Vegan, bakery) a short walk away; even more within reach of a $10 cab.  The bed is lofted and the fan can feel a little close from the ladder, but overall a very functional and welcoming space.",
