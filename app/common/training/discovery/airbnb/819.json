  "text": "The time we spent in Austin was just fantastic. Roman and Andrea are very kind hosts and they did a great job with the studio they rent out. 6th street and Downtown are not far from the appartment and we had everything we needed. Also, the two were very accommodating even though we arrived late in the evening. All in all, we enjoyed our time very much and can only recommend the place.",
