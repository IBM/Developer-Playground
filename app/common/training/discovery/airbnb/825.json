  "text": "Roman and Andrea's place was comfortable, clean and even more beautiful in person. The location was perfect for ACL and very central to everything else we did during our stay- restaurants, shopping and lady bird lake. Roman & Andrea were both so warm and welcoming and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. I would love to stay here again!",
