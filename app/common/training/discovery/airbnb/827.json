  "text": "We had a great time at Roman's studio in Austin's East Side. The location was a $6-12 lyft or uber to wherever you wanted to go. There is also a nice walkable path along the river just ~3 blocks away.\n\nRoman takes great care of the studio apartment... Everything was very clean. The space was even cuter in person than in the pictures. There was plenty of privacy, but Roman was around if we needed any advice for things to do and places to go.\n\nWe will try and stay again if it is available.",
