  "text": "We had such a great stay at Roman and Andrea's Private Studio. It is gorgeously designed, comfortable and just perfect for a few days. The bed was really comfy, and the neighbourhood is great. Not far from lots of great restaurants and cafes. They are lovely people and looked after us excellently! We'll be back we hope.",
