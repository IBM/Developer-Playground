  "text": "Roman was really welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay!(He even came by at night to fix the beeping fire alarm that we couldn't reach.) Everything was just as pictured. The loft bed made this space a memorable experience. The neighborhood was great, close enough to East 6th street (with all the bars) yet quiet and peaceful at night. Would recommend this place to friends!",
