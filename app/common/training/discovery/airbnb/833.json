  "text": "Absolutely wonderful hosts and a fantastic space. I was just in Austin for a short stay and had to work most of the time so I didn't get to take full advantage of Roman and Andrea's hospitality but my few interactions with them were great.  They even provided an umbrella for me which was clutch since it rained most of the time I was there. The unit was incredibly clean and roomier than most hotels. Location is sweet. I'd come back!",
