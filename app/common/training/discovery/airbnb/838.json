  "text": "Excellent little place. Clean, private, and nicely furnished. Had pretty much what we needed except a small fridge to keep yogourt for breakfast or a beer or two. That said, I would  not hesitate to recommend staying at this place. Well located for walking and access to some really funky and delicious restaurants and pubs. Make sure to ask Roman and Andrea for advice as they won't steer you wrong. I highly suggest this place and would stay there again in a heartbeat.",
