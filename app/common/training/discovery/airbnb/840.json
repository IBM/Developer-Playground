  "text": "Roman and Andrea's studio is very well presented and comfortable for two. The bathroom was stocked with organic products. Walking distance from the brilliant Rainey St, convenience store and the hike-and-bike trail. A car is recommended for getting around Austin, just make sure you're familiar with the one-way streets in Downtown.\r\nWe had an awesome time with Roman and Andrea and shared travel stories and experiences who were very welcoming and happy to suggest things to do (and BBQ to eat!). The neighbourhood is a 5 minute drive to Downtown and is very quiet. If you're coming to Austin, stay with these two!",
