  "text": "Andrea and Roman were the sweetest hosts! Nothing was too much trouble. We arrived late on a Friday night and there was a couple of local beers waiting for us. Welcome after our travels. The tiny house is exactly as it is in the photos. The bathroom exceptional. Location is an easy walk up to East Austin. We loved our stay at Andrea and Roman's and would definitely stay again!",
