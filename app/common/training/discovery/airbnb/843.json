  "text": "Beautiful home with welcoming, experienced hosts. Description of accommodations was perfect.  We loved the neighborhood with all the different architecture of the homes. Tons of great places nearby for dining/drinking/coffee.  Also, neighborhood is well serviced by Uber if you want to go out and not worry about driving. Roman / Andrea's home is just around the corner from this amazing running/biking trail on the river which is perfect for a short or long run. Would definitely stay here the next time we're in Austin!",
