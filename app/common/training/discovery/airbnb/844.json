  "text": "Really loved Roman and Andrea's apartment - it was exactly as described and in a great location. I was in Austin for SXSW and could walk to everything within around 1.5-2 miles -- just far enough away for it to be peaceful. \r\n\r\nRoman recommended a great restaurant called Laundrette which was a five min walk away. Fresh towels, shampoo/conditioner and beers in the fridge - better than being in a hotel. If I'm back in Austin in the future, I'll definitely stay here.",
