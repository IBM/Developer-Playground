  "text": "We enjoyed our stay.   It is an interesting space and was close to downtown and the river.   We walked the river trail every morning.  Yes, the ladder is a bit tricky to negotiate.  I'm a fit 60 y.o. and used caution, but if you are at all limited, Roman and Andrea's loft will be challenging.   No kitchen space so make sure you are not planning on a fridge.   Roman and Andrea were around next door and we really enjoyed talking to them, a great young couple.   They were great hosts.    I really like east Austin.  Get there before it changes too much!  Thanks",
