  "text": "This studio was beautiful--clean, minimal and located just a hop, skip and jump east of downtown. Andrea and Roman were great communicators and hosts--very responsive over text messaging.  I was visiting Austin on business and working long days, and it was a pleasure to spend the night in this space.\r\n\r\nThe bed is located in a loft. This is a really fun experience, but not for everyone.",
