  "text": "We stayed at Roman and Andrea's studio for two nights this past weekend and it was great. We were pretty busy with a friend's wedding and all of the events so we never got to meet Roman and Andrea but they were very available through phone and text. We had no problems getting in and out. The house was amazing and our little studio was perfect for the weekend. The bed was comfortable and the little love seat and TV was perfect for relaxing after so many busy events. The neighborhood was great and close to everything. We walked to an amazing breakfast spot, Cenote each morning and had the best coffee and breakfast. It was only about a 20 minute walk from the house. Everything else we needed to get to in Austin was close. We took Ubers everywhere and it was only abou $4-7 each way to get to Rainy St, downtown, etc. Roman and Andrea's place was my first airbnb and it was awesome. I would highly recommend it to anyone!",
