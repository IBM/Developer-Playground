  "text": "We loved our two nights at Andrea and Roman's cozy (yet airy) loft studio. The bed was very comfortable, as was the oversized chair, and the bathroom is spacious. We didn't spend as much time in the studio as I would've liked, as we were in town for a conference, but the space is so inviting that I can easily imagine hanging out with a book and a glass of wine. \r\n\r\nSuper smartly designed. The studio and the exterior space is just beautiful! \r\n\r\nAlso, the studio is in a great location! I used to live in Austin so I know the city fairly well, and this is the up-and-coming neighborhood, close to great restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Trust me, you'll love staying here!",
