  "text": "We had a lovely time at Andrea and Romans place.  They were kind enough to give us a call and offer to meet us at the property.  The location is walking distance to Lady bird lake and walking paths/parks.  What a treat to wake up to sunshine and the sound of birds.  Clean and simple space.  We would definitely stay again!",
