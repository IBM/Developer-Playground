  "text": "This is a great little place; the house is very smartly designed -- comfortable and clean. Roman and Andrea were great hosts (and we loved their pup Chandler), responding quickly to any questions and quick to offer restaurant recommendations (The Launderette was so good, and it's only a couple of blocks away). We'll definitely try to stay there next time we're in Austin. Thanks!",
