  "text": "Cute, modern and cozy room. The space was clean and the location was great. We brought our bikes and literally biked everywhere... dinner, downtown, hike and bike trail, etc. Highly recommend dining at Launderette for brunch. We had a minor issue and the owners were very apologetic, responsive, and compensated us for it.",
