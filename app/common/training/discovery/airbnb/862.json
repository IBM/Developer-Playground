  "text": "I absolutely loved this spot in Austin. The house was just stunning and so was the room. The bed was the perfect size for two (wider than I expected). The bathroom is clean and nicely painted. I love the overall aesthetic and decor of the room as well as the entire home. Andrea was very sweet and courteous to our privacy. Thanks so much for everything and making us feel welcome. I would absolutely recommend this place and would stay again!!!",
