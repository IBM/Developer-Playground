  "text": "From the start, Andrea was very welcoming as she gave us a little tour of the place and whereabouts. They were kind enough to save us some parking because the streets can get packed. We loved that its location is not too far from the city, and it's rather quiet so you don't have to worry too much about not sleeping. My girlfriend and I did not want to leave this place because it was very cozy. Overall we had a wonderful stay the the Pisano's and we'd definitely recommend this place!",
