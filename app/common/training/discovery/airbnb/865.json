  "text": "As soon as we arrived Andrea was there to greet us and show us around. The private studio was a great place and very close to downtown. They were very quiet as well so we didn't hear any noise from the house or outside. Even having to use the ladder to get to the bed was something I looked forward to each night! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a great one. Next time we visit Austin we will definitely book with Andrea & Roman again!",
