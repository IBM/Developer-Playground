Especially, if you love good eats like us you will love that you are walking distance from the best restaurants! Roman and Andrea were awesome hosts and we enjoyed getting to know them a bit! Sleeping in the loft was the best! We even had a electric water kettle in our space for hot tea and coffee!!",
