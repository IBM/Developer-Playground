  "text": "Space was as advertised: bright, clean, well-decorated and easy to relax in.  Very quiet side street within walking distance to East-side restaurants & a B-Cycle station.  Communication was easy & helpful - Andrea answered all my first-timer questions and Roman sent a quality list of recommendations for local dining and places to check out in Austin.  All good.  A sturdy handle at the top makes ladder navigation more secure.  Netflix + digital antenna to catch the Packer game.  ;) Way better than a hotel room for 2-3x the price!",
