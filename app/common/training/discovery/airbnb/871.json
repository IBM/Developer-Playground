  "text": "A cool modern take on a native Austin structure - an aesthetic treat. Well set up for a sleek crash pad and wonderful hosts. Requires some urban architecture dexterity - unconventional locks, loft ladder to bed... This is essentially a hotel room, without the hotel. For me it was a perfect fit - I was gone all day and most of the night and just needed to sleep and shower - and the neighborhood is full of gems. Might be a little lean for those looking for a vacation home experience, though the hosts and vibes are great",
