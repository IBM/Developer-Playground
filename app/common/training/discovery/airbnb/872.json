  "text": "Roman and Andrea were very communicative hosts! Check in was easy although our schedules did not line up and the space was welcoming and homey. Roman sent a large list of recommendations for the area before I had arrived. Overall I would recommend for others to stay here if they have the opportunity - it's in a great location with wonderful hosts.",
