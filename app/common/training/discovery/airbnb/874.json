  "text": "We had an amazing time at Andrea and Roman's crash pad in Austin Texas. We were able to go everywhere in Austin within a 10 minute drive, had unbelievable parking, and great recommendations from the host. We loved our time in Austin, and would spend it again in the crash pad. One of the greatest benefits of Andrea and Roman's crash pad was that it was located within a five minute walk of the Lady Bird Lake Trail. My wife and I are avid runners, and were thrilled to have this wonderful Trail located within a short distance of their home. They even provided us and iron and hairdryer upon request and the crash pad itself was very clean. We appreciated their detail, and their home. We would recommend staying with Andre and Roman to anyone if they plan on spending time in Austin.",
