  "text": "Roman and Andrea's place is modern and lovely. It is furnished beautifully and the attention to detail was great. We arrived and picked up our key while they weren't home and settled in. The loft bed was very comfortable. We stayed two nights and will recommend to our friends. Great location. Easy to get around especially with Uber.",
