  "text": "This was my first time using Airbnb and Billy certainly made it an enjoyable trip!\r\n\r\nHe did a beautiful job updating his studio...it couldn't have been more perfect and top of the line. \r\n\r\nHe was a gracious host and was very helpful with getting me settled. The studio even comes with a Nespresso maker which Billy so generously helped me figure out how to work.\r\n\r\nThe location is incredible and right up the street from a B-Cycle station which I used to get around the entire time.\r\n\r\nI'll definitely be staying here next time I'm back in Austin! :-)",
