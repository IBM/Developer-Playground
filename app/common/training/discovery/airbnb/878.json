  "text": "Billy's BnB was beautiful, with modern elegance and antique touches we felt at home for our weekend in ATX. We checked in quite late, he was nice and flexible enough to make arrangements. \n\nThe location was perfect, only a couple of minutes from downtown's 6th street and Zilker's Park Barton Springs Pool. There are great eateries near by including food truck stops, eccletic restaurants ,and delicious diners and drives. Everything else to do in Austin I'm sure you all know of and this classy neighborhood is in the perfect location for many activities.\n\nOur dogs also loved his place. Billy has a nice closed in patio/yard area. The convenience of letting our dogs out was awesome. Not only did our dogs enjoy the parks and patio dining, they had fun playing with Billy's dogs too.\n\nOur host Billy was delightful. He reassured our stay and was concerning of any other necessities. I would definitely recommend this BnB to anyone especially if you have pets to bring. Billy's shabby chic BnB will definitely bring comfort to your stay.",
