  "text": "My host was FANTASTIC. He gave me directions to the place, how much a taxi would cost from AUS, filled the fridge with water and hummus, had coffee ready, plenty of clean towels and blankets. The place is very cute and great for a couple. His puppies are also adorable. I got to meet them when I arrived. So close to ACL - BIG PLUS! The neighborhood is quiet, but you're only 3 blocks from Barton Springs where there are plenty of restaurants and food trucks!",
