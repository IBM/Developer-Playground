  "text": "My husband and I stayed at Billy's studio for funfunfun fest. It was nice, clean and just enough space for the two of us. It's in a great location within walking distance of anything you might need. Billy was very helpful anytime we needed anything and even gave us a nice shortcut into Austin which was great! I don't have a single bad thing to say about my first experience with air bnb or Billy's great little studio.",
