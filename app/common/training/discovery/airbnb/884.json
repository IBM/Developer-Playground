  "text": "Billy was great! The house was spotless, quant and just what I needed for my 1 week stay during SXSW. Walking distant to everything happening down town, but in a quieter neighborhood off the main stretch of things. Billy had great local advice that he was willing to share when needed, I'd definitely recommend and stay again!",
