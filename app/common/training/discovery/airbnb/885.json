  "text": "Billy was such a gracious host! When we arrived at his place, it was spotless and inviting. The fridge was stocked with beer, wine, a Brita and milk for coffee.  The counter was equipped with a Nescaf√© machine. The bed was SUPER comfy.  \n\nAfter we settled in, Billy introduced us to his two adorable pooches and invited us out to a nearby party at Hotel San Jose where we met one of his very cool friends.  \n\nBilly even hooked us up with some sxsw guest passes that got us access to some very cool events nearby.  \n\nDuring our trip, Billy went out of his way to make sure we felt welcomed and at ease.  He was always responsive by text and was easy to get along with.  We'll definitely go back to Austin and hope to stay with Billy again in the future.\n\nWe highly recommend staying with Billy.",
