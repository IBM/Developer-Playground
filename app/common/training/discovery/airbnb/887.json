  "text": "We have used Air BNB in Austin several times and this was our favorite spot! It was clean, comfortable and in an ideal location. Billy was a very kind and flexible host and we absolutely loved everything about our stay. The place is very private but we were able to meet his two adorable dogs! I would definitely stay here again!!",
