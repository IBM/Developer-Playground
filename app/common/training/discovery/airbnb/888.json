  "text": "Great location in a cute and private studio in Austin! The studio was beautifully maintained and very clean. Location was perfect - halfway between zilker park and downtown with lots to do in walking distance! It was also very accommodating to bring our little dog - which is always appreciated! Will definitely stay here again if we return to Austin!",
