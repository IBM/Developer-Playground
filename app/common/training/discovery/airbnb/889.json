Located on a beautifully quiet residential street yet  it's walking distance from some of the best of what Austin has to offer. \n\nBilly was beyond accommodating.\nFrom the guest house being stocked with beer, coffee, and TopoChico to his complete understanding / help with our early check-in / late check-out needs.\n\nBilly and his place are the reason why Airbnb > hotels.",
