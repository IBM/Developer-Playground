  "text": "Billy was incredible! My husband, myself and our 9lb dog were traveling cross country and were stopping in Austin for the night. We had a reservation at another house on airbnb that fell through 30 minutes before our arrival in Austin. We reached out to billy and he responded quickly and was eager to help us and get the room ready for us before our arrival. The studio apt was perfect for us! It was so clean and had all of the amenities you would need for a night. He was so accommodating and even had beer and wine in the fridge which we needed after frantically trying to find a new place so quickly. We would definitely stay here again!",
