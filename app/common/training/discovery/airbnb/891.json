  "text": "Billy's place is quaint and cute. It matches the description exactly. Location is good. It's right around the corner from South Congress and an easy Uber ride to downtown. Billy was also really accommodating. He stocked the fridge with wine and invited us to join his bbq on the 4th. Highly recommended!",
