  "text": "Billy and the home were absolutely awesome! My husband and I were able to take a last minute day trip to ATX and we found his posting the night before we wanted to check in. Billy even had other guests staying in the home the night before we wanted to stay and he was so great to get the home turned around for us to stay for the evening. Perfect location to all things Austin making our night and anniversary celebration just that more special! We will most definitely be spending more nights in Billy's home and recommend him and the home to all AirBNB users!",
