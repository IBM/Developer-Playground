  "text": "The studio that Billy has put together is very cozy. The bed was the best one I've slept on during my vacation to Texas. There is a nice/quiet mini fridge, a/c, and ceiling fan. I'd stay here again in a heart beat. On top of the studio being nice Billy is a pretty relaxed guy and a good host!",
