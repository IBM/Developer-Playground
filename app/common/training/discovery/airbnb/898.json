  "text": "Loved my stay at the studio! I believe the photos don't do it justice - the interior was very cute and cozy, with style to spare. Very very comfy bed with a nice choice of blankets. Kitchenette was well equipped, including a Nespresso.  \r\n\r\nVery short and cheap ($4-6 most of the time) Uber to key locations on South Lamar and South Congress.\r\n\r\nBilly was a lovely and generous host, with a great Austin vibe! :)\r\n\r\nWould definitely stay here again, and as soon as I get the next chance!",
