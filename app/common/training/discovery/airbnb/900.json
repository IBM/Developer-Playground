  "text": "Both Billy and his cute studio were absolutely fantastic. The location is great - close enough to walk downtown (25 minutes) but in a beautiful and charming neighborhood filled with trees and cacti. The space itself is very comfortable - big bathroom, comfy bed and nicely decorated. I felt right at home! Billy was super friendly and made sure to ask me if I needed any help or advice for things to do around town. During my stay it was very rainy, and he went out of his way to dig through the garage to find me one to borrow. Just keep in mind there is no stove/microwave! I ate my morning oats cold, but they were still delicious :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to getting back to Austin soon and staying again! Thanks Billy!",
