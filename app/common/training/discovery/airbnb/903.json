  "text": "Perfect base for SXSW Interactive - there's a bus almost right at the door that takes you downtown in only about 20 minutes for just a buck.\r\nOur hosts could not have been more thoughtful – picked us up at the airport, the fridge was full of food, and there was even some beer!\r\nThey've restored the house really well, it's very peaceful and quiet, and the neighbourhood is great – a good coffee shop, a Mexican, a good neighbourhood Italian and a couple of grocery stores all within 2 minutes walk.\r\nIf you want to experience a bit of real Austin living, but at the same time be close to the action for music / festivals / conventions, then this is a great choice.",
