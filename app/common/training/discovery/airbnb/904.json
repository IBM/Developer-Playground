  "text": "This was a wonderful place to stay in an excellent neighborhood!  Ananda  has done a wonderful job of of making the space warm, bright and a joy to be in.  The neigborhood is very quiet yet full of excitement, it has one of the oldest golf courses in the Austin area close by, and though I didn't golf, it was a perfect area to walk through in the evening after a delicious meal in one the restaurants within a couple blocks of the house.  My three boys and I went down for spring break, and had a great time.  Ananda has great attention for the details, the coffee was excellent, fresh, new soap bars, board games and cards to play games in the (website hidden) and X-box was a hit with boys too!  I can't remember how many quick runs for specialty items at the bakery and at the fantastic cheese specialty shop we made, but wow, the salted oatmeal raisin cookies were perfect with coffee! \r\nWe did some sight seeing and attended some of the South By Southwest events and the #7 bus is a 20 second walk and for a couple bucks you can access most of the Austin area very easily.  \r\nI know that I will be staying here the next time I go to Austin!  Highly recommend Ananda's wonderful home even though I would like to keep this gem to myself!",
