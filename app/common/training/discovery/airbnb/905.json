  "text": "We loved some much Austin after beeing at SXSW Festival that we decided to stay one more week just for fun and rest. We chose the Bungalow of Dunstan and Ananda for this week and it was the perfect choose for us. \r\nDo you want to live the real Austin lifestyle in a peaceful neighborhood and quiet neighbourhood ? Don't search elsewhere :) This house is perfectly clean and really quiet. These hosts are very nice and funny. You can find everything you want in HEB which is very close to this home.\r\nSo... Don't hesitate to contact them and have a great trip in Austin ^^",
