  "text": "The place is super cute and very clean. The neighborhood is adorable, and I'd actually rather stay in Hyde Park than downtown. Lot's to walk to, including restaurants and grocery. Check in and check out were seamless. Ananda checked in and made sure everything was good - I'd recommend this place.",
