  "text": "Ananda and Dunstan were great hosts. The bungalow is very comfortable and in a great neighborhood that is adjacent to a golf course. There are a few places to eat within walking distance and the UT campus and downtown are not far away (by bus/car/scooter). For a relaxing weekend or vacation, this bungalow allows you to enjoy Austin and also stretch out a bit and take in a peaceful relaxing, neighborhood feel. I would definitely recommend this bungalow! And, if you're up for it, rent a scooter from (email hidden) check out the city on two wheels.",
