  "text": "We had a really good experience.  Hyde Park is a very quiet and pretty neighborhood.  There are nice places to walk including the nearby golf course and up to restaurants and shops just a few blocks away.  The apartment is very spacious and well-appointed.  Ananda and Dunstan are in the back of the property. They are extremely nice people and were very attentive if we needed anything.  Ananda has really thought through how to make the apartment comfortable and it is well-appointed - even with a bit of food and drink.  \r\n\r\nCheck-in was super-easy and flexible. \r\n\r\nThe front porch is a really nice place to hang out.\r\n\r\nWe definitely recommend this place!",
