  "text": "This little bugalow was nestled in a great little part of Hyde Park and was in walking distance of some great neighborhood eateries like Hyde Park Grill and Vino Vino. The accommodations were perfectly suited for what we were looking for in an Austin getaway and had all the amenities you'd expect from a hotel but with the charm only available from a BnB.  We absolutely loved it and will never forget out stay.",
