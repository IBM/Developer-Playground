  "text": "Ananda and Dunstan were outstanding hosts.  They were friendly, generous, considerate and they included many nice amenities that made it feel as though I were staying with close friends.  The bungalow was amazing and the location was great.  I sincerely doubt you'll find a better place to stay and I know you will not find better hosts, from the plate of fresh chocolate chip cookies when I checked in to the collection of menus from local eateries, Ananda and Dunstan covered all the bases and made sure everything was taken care of.  I can not wait to get back for another visit!",
