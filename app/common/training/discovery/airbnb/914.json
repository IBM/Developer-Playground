  "text": "Ananda and Dunstan were excellent hosts! They stopped by to see if I needed anything, gifted me some goat milk, since I'd asked advice about where to find some, and even tried to wine and dine me. Unfortunately, my busy schedule while in Austin prevented that, but I totally loved that they were so friendly and open. The house was delightfully decorated, clean, comfortable, and uncluttered. They also provided useful toiletries, and breakfast things, which was really helpful. My sole caveat about this wonderful cottage is that the bed is on the soft side.",
