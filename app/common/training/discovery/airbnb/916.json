You won't find a more beautiful place or neighborhood, I swear!\r\n\r\nMy stay was an unusual one as I live in Austin, but rented the space for a week to treat myself to a mini artist residency with an open house of sorts for people to view a performance art installation at the end.  The house was so neat and clean, and such a beautiful space to be in!  \r\n\r\nSeriously, stay here!",
