  "text": "This easily ranks among the best places I've ever rented: clean, comfortable, well-equipped, large enough to fit a whole family (but not too big if you're on your own like I was), and located in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood that's not too far away from downtown. Ananda and Dunstan are the perfect hosts, they will leave you as much space as you like but they're both fun to talk to. Ananda even gave me a ride back to the airport! It took me about twenty minutes to walk to the UT campus and twenty more to get to Sixth Street. It's a fun walk--and there may be places closer by, but I think you'll have a hard time finding another rental as good as this one!",
