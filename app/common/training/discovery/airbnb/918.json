  "text": "Ananda & Dunstan were amazing hosts!  The bungalow has plenty of room and was immaculate.  They were quick to respond to questions and came over and introduced themselves.  They even left us a bottle of wine to toast to our first time in Austin!  The location is fantastic, there are bus stops right at the top of the street and there are some great neighborhood cafes and stores 3 blocks away.  We had a comfortable and fun stay in Austin and when we come back, we will definitely be back to stay here!  Thank you Ananda & Dunstan again!",
