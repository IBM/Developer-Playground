  "text": "Ananda's home was PERFECT for my husband and I and our 18 month old son.  In particular, the house was pre-stocked with food and snacks which saved us a trip to the store on our first night there.  With a toddler after a 4 hour plane trip, trust me, these little things matter.  There was even beer in the fridge!  (If I drank beer, I'd be happy about that!)\r\n\r\nThe home was very clean, comfortable, and uncluttered.  I barely had to do much to make it toddler-friendly.  Our hosts were available when we needed them and very accomodating.  Basically, I don't see any reason to stay anywhere else when we're in Austin - the price for 2 bedroom with a kitchen was half what you'd pay for a nice hotel room and you would not have all the space you have here.  \r\n\r\nI sort of forgot I was traveling, the home just felt like some place I could easily come back to and not think too much about.  I would highly recommend Ananda's home for your next trip to Austin if you want a low-key, convenient, comfortable, quiet, clean and accommodating place to stay.",
