  "text": "A quaint little house in Hyde Park made our stay in Austin for the first Formula 1 race an absolute joy. We were three people so we each had our own bedroom and with a full kitchen we could hang around the house in the mornings rather than go out for breakfast. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is really nice and with only a 10 minute taxi ride downtown it's very convenient as well. \r\n\r\nAnanda and Dunstan where perfect hosts and everything was provided to make our stay as pleasant as possible.",
