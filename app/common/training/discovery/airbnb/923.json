  "text": "This house is in excellent shape, the location is great if you want to experience a cool central Austin neighborhood and I would definitely recommend staying here. Good hosting with some light breakfast supplies to get us started and a bottle of wine thoughtfully left for us to enjoy on the porch. Only reason I did not give it five stars was some early morning dog noise that woke us up but I have a feeling that is not a normal occurrence.",
