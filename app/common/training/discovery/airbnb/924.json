  "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed at Dustan and Ananda's bungalow for 2 months. \nPros: \n-great communication with the hosts and any issues were resolved in a timely manner\n-the space is nice: 2 bedrooms, bathroom, living room, kitchen, and dining room\n-great neighborhood: quiet, bus stop across the street. We walked and biked most of the time\n-off street parking was always available\n-Always functioning wifi and cable\n-nice running trail around the golf course, 1/2 block away\nCons: \n-the living room furniture was not very functional for lounging. The couch was small and uncomfortable.\n-no outlets in the bathroom\n-the shower head was low with low water pressure. \n-we couldn't quite figure out the layout behind the bungalow, but you do share the back wall/door with the hosts so it doesn't feel as private when you can hear the commotion and smell the cooking on the other side\n-I don't know if it was just when we were guests, but there was constant laundry going on, which seemed to limit the hot water. The laundry room shares the wall with the kitchen\n\nAll in all, great place to stay if you're visiting Austin",
