  "text": "This is a charming little place that is bright and very clean. We stayed for SXSW and it worked out great. I was surprised by how easy it is to jump on a bus to downtown Austin. Only $1 and you are downtown in something like 15 minutes for less than a block away (a cab from 6th street is under $15).\r\n\r\nWhen we had an issue with the internet, Dunstan was on the case in 5 minutes time and got it sorted right out. It was never an issue again. It was also super nice of them to leave some snacks and Shiners in the place for us. Would definitely consider staying here again!",
