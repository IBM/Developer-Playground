  "text": "Ananda & Dunstan have a beautiful home and made our stay in Austin wonderful. Five of us had plenty of room and were very comfortable here. The house is well maintained and very clean. The location was great and we all enjoyed walking up the block to Dolce Vita and Julio's. They provided plenty of information on local transportation and entertainment. We also greatly appreciated the coffee, breakfast snacks, and bottle of wine they left for us.\r\nWould definitely stay here again.",
