  "text": "Amanda and Dunstan have a nice place -- clean, spacious and convenient. As others mentioned, we appreciated the bottle of wine, especially because we arrived late. The coffee was better than most we had on our trip. The couch is not particularly comfortable, but the beds are. Note that you can get on all-day bus pass for only $2, and can get it when you board the bus. Both the #7 & #10 are nearby and will get you downtown.",
