  "text": "Very great location for me.  Comfortable, charming, clean home with easy access to central Austin and easy parking.  Living in Austin for 8 years, this to me is a quintessential sleepy, yet vibrant Austin neighborhood--tree lined, sunny Bungalow filled, friendly scene that is residential with quick access to other amenities. This retreat is attached to the main house so you share a wall but I was comfortable with that.  Hosts were pleasant and available. All and all a great experience.",
