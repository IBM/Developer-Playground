  "text": "I'll start off by saying that most 5 star reviews are due to a lack of effort of the reviewer's part. This is not the case for my review. I would have given 4 stars for a clean, comfortable and affordable stay in this house. The 5th star was earned by Ananda being a very gracious host; more on that below.\r\n\r\nThis is a quaint bungalow in a very scenic and active neighborhood, reminiscent of my native Houston Heights. Due to a tipped over crane at my job, my friends and I arrived at the house around 1 am! No worries though, the door has a keyless entry via security code that was sent to me earlier that day. Disaster #1 averted thanks to owner :)\r\n\r\nMy time in Austin was filled with a start up conference, which ran WAY later than expected during the last day of my trip. Ananda assured me that my group could leave our bags in the house until the conference was over and had no complaints when the conference ran until 7pm... I don't know any hotels that gracious.\r\n\r\nI'll be checking availability here on my next trip to Austin.",
