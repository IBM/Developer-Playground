  "text": "An absolute delight. You really should stay here if you're in Austin. I stayed in the bungalow for 3 nights with a colleague when we were in town for the SXSW Eco conference. The house is LOVELY, charming and incredibly comfortable, located in a charming leafy neighborhood. There's a bunch of charming cafes and restaurants about a block away, and the neighborhood is wonderful for a morning run. The stop for the #7 bus into downtown is right around the corner and incredibly easy and convenient. Ananda and Dunstan are accommodating, easy to reach by email, and were kind enough to let us leave our luggage at the house during the day before our late night flight. And they compost!! \r\n\r\nAll in all this was wonderful experience, and I will DEFINITELY stay with Ananda and Dunstan when I'm in Austin again. Thanks to you both! :)",
