  "text": "My wife, baby, and I stayed here for 5 nights. It is a very comfortable, homey bungalow in an ideal location for access to downtown and central Austin. We loved the full kitchen, comfortable beds, Roku, and quiet street within walking distance to a few coffee shops. A few mornings, I went out running around the golf course situated no more than 100 feet from the front door. Ananda and Dunstan were incredibly responsive, helpful, and generous. Case in point: After the internet had gone out one evening, leaving us without streaming Netflix (which we depend on after the baby goes to sleep), Ananda brought us a gift card to a local bakery up the street to say sorry for the snafu. All in all, we could not have asked for a better place to stay.",
