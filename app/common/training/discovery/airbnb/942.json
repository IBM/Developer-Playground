  "text": "We stayed in this house for 4 nights, and it was a wonderful experience. The house itself is very spacious with a good deal of helpful information at your fingertips, whether it be a map, some flyers from local restaurants, or the wonderful recommendations from the extremely helpful Ananda and Dunstan. \r\n\r\nWe were quite fond of the ceiling fans in each room and having a fully functioning house, so if you wanted to cook in or simply break open a bottle of wine and play games, you could with ease. The two bedrooms are separated by a bathroom, so you have your privacy. Having a Roku in the living room was wonderful for when we just wanted to relax and catch up on a show or two. \r\n\r\nWe often found ourselves walking up the street to have a nightcap or to grab a few groceries. If you need to drive (although a bus is just up the street) to downtown Austin, it takes about 7 minutes or so. We did this each and every day, and still were able to pop home for some downtime before going out for more activities. \r\n\r\nThe combination of the house itself, the wonderful hosts, and the fantastic location, we would definitely love to stay here again.",
