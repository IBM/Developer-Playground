  "text": "Great, responsive hosts and a very good place to stay when visiting Austin. I rented this for my girlfriend's parents who were visiting us and they loved it. It's within walking distance of multiple cafes and restaurants, and the location is on a quiet street lined with trees. It even has a front porch where you can sit with your morning coffee (or evening wine). The house itself was clean, nicely decorated,  and well stocked with the things you need. Great rental. Highly recommended.",
