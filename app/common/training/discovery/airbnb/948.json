  "text": "This Hyde Park Bungalow is a fantastic place to stay in Austin. It has all the space and comfort you need. Both Campus (25 mins) and Downtown (40 mins) are within walking distance, or you can take a bus and get there even faster. The Hyde Park area is also very nice and quiet, with a couple of restaurants and a supermarket nearby on Duval Street. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about this place is the great owners. Ananda and Dunstan are very friendly and eager to help out. Be sure to say hi to their dogs!",
