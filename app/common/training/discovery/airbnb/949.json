  "text": "We stayed at the house for a whole month and had a wonderful experience. The house is very cute and well equipped for cooking and having company. The beds are very comfortable, and there is plenty of hot water. The location is great, residential,  but close to UT and downtown. We actually walked to UT everyday. We loved sitting on the front porch with a glass of wine watching the sunset.\r\nAnanda and Dunstan were great hosts. They responded to our requests or questions right away, and had a lot of good information.\r\nWe will not hesitate to stay there again, and highly recommend the place.\r\nThanks Ananda and Dunstan",
