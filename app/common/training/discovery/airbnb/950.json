  "text": "We, my parents, boyfriend and I, enjoyed our stay here! We were comfortable at all times. This is a very quiet neighborhood and I love the fact that there was tons of people running for exercise. It definitely got my boyfriend out there. My mom is a clean freak and was impressed on how clean it was! We did some cooking in the house and had everything we needed. Definitely will stay again.",
