  "text": "We had a wonderful time staying at this Hyde Park Bungalow during our time in Austin and would totally recommend this place to anyone visiting.  Hyde Park is a nice and quiet part of town, but very close to all the sights Austin has to offer. Ananda and Dunstan were great and very nice!",
