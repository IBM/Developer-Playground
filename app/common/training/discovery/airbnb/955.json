  "text": "The Hyde Park Bungalow was perfect for our stay.  The house is well appointed in Austin, it is very easy to get to local destinations.  The house is very quiet and in a nice walking neighborhood.  Within a half of a mile there are restaurants, coffee shops and major grocery stores.  The beds are comfortable and the porch is very nice to hang out on in the morning and evenings.  The hosts are respectful and were very accommodating to the few requests that we had.  I will stay here again when we are in Austin!",
