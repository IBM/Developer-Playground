  "text": "I got to Austin and Amanda and Dunstan had gone out of town for a family matter.\r\nI'm very sorry I never got to thank them in person for allowing me to stay at their lovely home.  The house was so nice, clean and comfortable.  In addition to the wi-fi, digital TV, the kitchen had all the pots, pans and utensils you could think of. I had a very nice time and would definitely stay there again and have already recommend it to some friends. It's a great place to stay for anyone looking for a quite, local taste of Austin.",
