The house was comfortable and the neighbourhood very convenient - good connectivity by bus and  close to the grocery store and some restaurants. Everything was in good working condition in the house. Ananda and Dunstan are very friendly and welcoming. The place is very comfortable for 3 adults or 2 adults and 2 children to stay. If necessary, 4 adults can be accommodated as well.",
