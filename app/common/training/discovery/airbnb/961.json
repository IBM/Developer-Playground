  "text": "We loved our stay at the Hyde Park Bungalow!  It is in a really great location and our family took walks around the beautiful neighborhood every evening.  A couple evenings we walked to a local spot for dinner.  The kitchen was well stocked and had everything we needed.  We really hope to stay at Ananda and Dunstan's place again because it was just lovely!",
