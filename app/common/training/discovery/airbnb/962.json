  "text": "We had a great stay at Ananda and Dunstan's bungalow in Hyde Park.  The location was great, it was away from the \"city\" enough and in a very quiet setting.  Yet close enough to be in the heart of Austin within 10 minutes.  Would definitely stay there again, if we return to Austin.  My 16 year old and his friend attended the RTX convention while we were there.  One slept in the bedroom, the other slept in the living room.  My younger son and I slept in the 2nd bedroom.  Easily enough room for 4 people.",
