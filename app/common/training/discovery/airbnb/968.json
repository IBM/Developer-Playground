  "text": "I LOVED staying here. It was a perfect location in the lovely, quiet, picturesque Hyde Park neighborhood right down the street from my favorite Austin restaurant, Mother's. The apartment was spotless and lovingly decorated and had the required vacation-in-the-South front porch.\r\n\r\nAnanda and Dunstan were really lovely hosts - fun to chat with in passing and easy to connect with about check out.",
