  "text": "We had a great stay at Dunstan and Ananda's very cute bungalow in a quiet neighborhood in Austin.  It's right across the street from a running trail and there are a few amazing restaurants just down the street--Julio's Cafe and the Quack Bakery were both amazing.\r\n\r\nThe place was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  I'd definitely stay again!",
