  "text": "We absolutely loved this little bungalow. It was in a perfect location. We were able to get downtown in less that 10 minutes. The beds were comfortable and the atmosphere was so cozy. My husband and I stayed here with a friend and everyone had plenty of space! I loved the key less entry because it meant we didn't have to worry about keeping up with a key. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this bungalow for to anyone that is going to Austin that wants to be centrally located and stay in a quiet, safe neighborhood. It was very close to excellent restaurants and some really cute vintage shops! I hope to come back soon!",
