  "text": "Amanda & Dunstan's bungalo was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. We met Ananda the first night, she was enthusiastic to make recommendations and very welcoming. Ananda and Dunstan wanted to make sure that our stay was comfortable and relaxing and that we were enjoying Austin. The neighborhood is perfect! H-E-B is right around the corner, Dolce Vita and Hyde Park bar and Grill are within walking distance and it's an uber ride about $10-15 to east six street.  We had a great stay and would stay again.",
