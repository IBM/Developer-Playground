  "text": "We stayed here for ACL weekend and it was perfect.  A party of 4 can stay here comfortably and have their own space. This is a much better option than getting a hotel room for a weekend.   Ananda was out of town but Dunstan came by to check on us to be sure all was well. This place is affordable, has everything you need and is close to local restaurants.  An Uber ride to Zilker Park cost about $15 for those that are wondering.    I would definitely recommend staying here.  We will use them again for future visits to Austin.",
