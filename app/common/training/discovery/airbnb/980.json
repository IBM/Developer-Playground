  "text": "My stay with Ananda and Dunstan was really pleasant. The area is quiet and their place is really cozy. The sheets were the softest I've ever slept on. The internet and Roku box worked great. The neighborhood is super safe. I rode my bike and walked around at night and never felt uncomfortable. There's a Juiceland 5 blocks away and delicious Mexican food 3 blocks away across from a bus stop. Overall it was a great way to experience a real Austin neighborhood.",
