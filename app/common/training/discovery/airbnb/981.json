  "text": "Our stay was great and the house was just what we wanted.  The neighborhood was lovely and quiet, but not too far from anywhere we were going.  The hosts accommodated our request for early check-in so that our baby could have a midday nap after a morning of traveling.  It was definitely more comfortable than any hotel we could have stayed in, especially for our family of 4.  We would stay here again on future visits to Austin!",
