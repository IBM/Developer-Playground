  "text": "Great house! Well-appointed in an excellent location next to the Hancock Golf Course. An Uber to downtown cost about $12. Keyless entry via keypad (so no fumbling with keys, very convenient) and plenty of street parking. I really enjoyed staying at Ananda and Dunstan's house and can give it my highest recommendation.",
