  "text": "We really enjoyed our 6 nights at Ananda and Dunstan's \"Hyde Park Bungalow\". The house was in a great neighborhood with a small grocery store and several good restaurants nearby. The house was cozy and clean with plenty of space to spread out and a nice dining and kitchen area. Both Ananda and Dunstan were so helpful. We would definitely book here again.",
