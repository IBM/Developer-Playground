  "text": "Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed staying at Ananda and Dunstan's place in Hyde Park.\r\nWe love Hyde Park and this place a lovely location right by the little golf course. \r\nWe didn't get to meet Ananda on this trip, Dunstan was warm and friendly in all our interactions and it was a pleasure to meet him.\r\nThe place felt like a total home to us and the kitchen was well equipped even with a juicer. The shower is good, too and if we hadn't had all our toiletries, we would have been totally fine because of all the things in the bathroom closet to use.\r\nWe only used one of the bedrooms and slept really well there.\r\nThe place was pretty and clean and just felt really good. We would totally stay here again.",
