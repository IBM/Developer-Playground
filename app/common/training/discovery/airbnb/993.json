  "text": "We stayed Ananda and Dunsten's bungalow on our recent visit to Austin.  It is exactly as picture-very comfortable.  Hyde Park is very accessible to downtown, I-35, UT, Lamar, and Mopac.  Very central location.  I would highly recommend it!  Ananda has a list of local coffee shop, laundry facility, etc on the fridge.  All within walking distance.",
