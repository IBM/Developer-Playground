  "text": "My husband, mother in law and son stayed Ananda and Dunsten's bungalow in late Jan. We ran into Amanda and she was friendly Dunsten stopped in one day to make sure we had everything we needed. The place was nice a lot of light and cozy. We liked how we were in so close to the golf course (we took out toddler on walks around the course). However, the door connecting the bathroom to the back bedroom does not shut properly. Besides that Great place!",
