  "text": "Ananda and Dustan communicated very well throughout the process. They provided the entry code to the house by text message the day we arrived, which simplified checking in. The house is in a fantastic location in Hyde Park, and is cozy and clean. They provide coffee, which is a big plus for me personally. The stay was enjoyable.",
