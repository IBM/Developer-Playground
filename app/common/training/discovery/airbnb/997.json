  "text": "Our family of 4 enjoyed 5 nights at Ananda and Dunstan's house in Hyde Park.  The location was ideal for us, as it was walking distance to a grocery store and to several restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the recreation center at the nearby golf course, which provided indoor activities for the kids on several rainy days.  The house is very clean and the kitchen is well-equipped. The Wi-fi worked very well, and the Roku box was a nice addition, especially for the rainy days during our stay. Ananda responded to inquiries very promptly.  We would not hesitate to stay at Ananda and Dunstan's house again on future trips to Austin.",
