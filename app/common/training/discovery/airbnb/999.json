  "text": "Lovely home and terrific location!\r\nWe loved staying at Ananda & Dunstan's home - it was cozy, comfortable, and the location was ideal. The neighborhood is friendly and quiet, and easy to walk or bike or get around to central Austin. Ananda and Dunstan were great (and their dogs are very sweet), and they were really sweet with our 3-year-old; Dunstan even brought her a cupcake on Easter. We will absolutely recommend this home to anyone traveling to Austin, and hope to be back!",
