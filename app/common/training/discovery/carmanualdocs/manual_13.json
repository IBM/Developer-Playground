{"body": "Use a belt-positioning booster seat for children who have outgrown or no longer properly fit in a child safety seat (generally children who are less than 4 feet 9 inches (1.45 meters) tall, are greater than age four (4) and less than age twelve (12), and between 40 pounds (18 kilograms) and 80 pounds (36 kilograms) and upward to 100 pounds (45 kilograms) if recommended by your child restraint manufacturer). Many state and provincial laws require that children use approved booster seats until they reach age eight, a height of 4 feet 9 inches (1.45 meters) tall, or 80 pounds (36 kilograms).<br><br>Booster seats should be used until you can answer YES to ALL of these questions when seated without a booster seat:<br><br>Always use booster seats in conjunction with your vehicle lap and shoulder belt.<br><br>If your backless booster seat has a removable shield, remove the shield. If a vehicle seating position has a low seat back or no head restraint, a backless booster seat may place your child's head (as measured at the tops of the ears) above the top of the seat.
