This potentially includes information about the performance or status of various systems and modules in the vehicle, such as engine, throttle, steering or brake systems.

Data may be provided to our service providers such as part suppliers that may help diagnose malfunctions, and who are similarly obligated to protect data. We retain this data only as long as necessary to perform these functions or to comply with law. We may provide information where required in response to official requests to law enforcement or other government authorities or third parties acting with lawful authority or court order, and such information may be used in legal proceedings.
