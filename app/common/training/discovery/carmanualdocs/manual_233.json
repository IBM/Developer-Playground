Any removal, reproduction, reverse engineering or other unauthorized use of the software from this system in violation of the license agreement is strictly prohibited and may subject you to legal action.<br><br>Read and follow instructions: Before using your Windows Automotive- based system, read and follow all instructions and safety information provided in this end user manual (\"User's Guide\"). Not following precautions found in this User's Guide can lead to an accident or other serious consequences.<br><br>Keep User's Guide in vehicle: When kept in the vehicle, the User's Guide will be a ready reference for you and other users unfamiliar with the Windows Automotive-based system. Please make certain that before using the system for the first time, all persons have access to the User's Guide and read its instructions and safety information carefully.<br><br>Voice Command Control: Functions within the Windows Automotive-based system may be accomplished using only voice commands. Using voice commands while driving allows you to operate the system without removing your hands from the wheel.<br><br>Prolonged Views of Screen: Do not access any function requiring a prolonged view of the screen while you are driving. Pull over in a safe and legal manner before attempting to access a function of the system requiring prolonged attention. Even occasional short scans to the screen may be hazardous if your attention has been diverted away from your driving task at a critical time.<br><br>Volume Setting: Do not raise the volume excessively. Keep the volume at a level where you can still hear outside traffic and emergency signals while driving. Driving while unable to hear these sounds could cause an accident.<br><br>Use of Speech Recognition Functions: Speech recognition software is inherently a statistical process which is subject to errors. It is your responsibility to monitor any speech recognition functions included in the system and address any errors.<br><br>Navigation Features: Any navigation features included in the system are intended to provide turn by turn instructions to get you to a desired destination. Please make certain all persons using this system carefully read and follow instructions and safety information fully.<br><br>Distraction Hazard: Any navigation features may require manual (non-verbal) setup. Attempting to perform such set-up or insert data while driving can seriously distract your attention and could cause an accident or other serious consequences. Stop the vehicle in a safe and legal manner before attempting these operations.<br><br>Let Your Judgment Prevail: Any navigation features are provided only as an aid. Make your driving decisions based on your observations of local conditions and existing traffic regulations. Any such feature is not a substitute for your personal judgment. Any route suggestions made by this system should never replace any local traffic regulations or your personal judgment or knowledge of safe driving practices.<br><br>Route Safety: Do not follow the route suggestions if doing so would result in an unsafe or illegal maneuver, if you would be placed in an unsafe situation, or if you would be directed into an area that you consider unsafe. The driver is ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle and therefore, must evaluate whether it is safe to follow the suggested directions.<br><br>Potential Map Inaccuracy: Maps used by this system may be inaccurate because of changes in roads, traffic controls or driving conditions. Always use good judgment and common sense when following the suggested routes.<br><br>Emergency Services: Do not rely on any navigation features included in the system to route you to emergency services. Ask local authorities or an emergency services operator for these locations. Not all emergency services such as police, fire stations, hospitals and clinics are likely to be contained in the map database for such navigation features.<br><br>Please read these terms and conditions carefully before you use the Telenav Software.

Any removal, reproduction, reverse engineering or other unauthorized use of the software from this system in violation of the license agreement is strictly prohibited and may subject you to legal action.</p><p><b>Read and follow instructions:</b> Before using your Windows Automotive- based system, read and follow all instructions and safety information provided in this end user manual (\"User's Guide\"). Not following precautions found in this User's Guide can lead to an accident or other serious consequences.</p><p><b>Keep User's Guide in vehicle:</b> When kept in the vehicle, the User's Guide will be a ready reference for you and other users unfamiliar with the Windows Automotive-based system. Please make certain that before using the system for the first time, all persons have access to the User's Guide and read its instructions and safety information carefully.</p><p><b>Voice Command Control:</b> Functions within the Windows Automotive-based system may be accomplished using only voice commands. Using voice commands while driving allows you to operate the system without removing your hands from the wheel.</p><p><b>Prolonged Views of Screen:</b> Do not access any function requiring a prolonged view of the screen while you are driving. Pull over in a safe and legal manner before attempting to access a function of the system requiring prolonged attention. Even occasional short scans to the screen may be hazardous if your attention has been diverted away from your driving task at a critical time.</p><p><b>Volume Setting:</b> Do not raise the volume excessively. Keep the volume at a level where you can still hear outside traffic and emergency signals while driving. Driving while unable to hear these sounds could cause an accident.</p><p><b>Use of Speech Recognition Functions:</b> Speech recognition software is inherently a statistical process which is subject to errors. It is your responsibility to monitor any speech recognition functions included in the system and address any errors.</p><p><b>Navigation Features:</b> Any navigation features included in the system are intended to provide turn by turn instructions to get you to a desired destination. Please make certain all persons using this system carefully read and follow instructions and safety information fully.</p><p><b>Distraction Hazard:</b> Any navigation features may require manual (non-verbal) setup. Attempting to perform such set-up or insert data while driving can seriously distract your attention and could cause an accident or other serious consequences. Stop the vehicle in a safe and legal manner before attempting these operations.</p><p><b>Let Your Judgment Prevail:</b> Any navigation features are provided only as an aid. Make your driving decisions based on your observations of local conditions and existing traffic regulations. Any such feature is not a substitute for your personal judgment. Any route suggestions made by this system should never replace any local traffic regulations or your personal judgment or knowledge of safe driving practices.</p><p><b>Route Safety:</b> Do not follow the route suggestions if doing so would result in an unsafe or illegal maneuver, if you would be placed in an unsafe situation, or if you would be directed into an area that you consider unsafe. The driver is ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle and therefore, must evaluate whether it is safe to follow the suggested directions.</p><p><b>Potential Map Inaccuracy:</b> Maps used by this system may be inaccurate because of changes in roads, traffic controls or driving conditions. Always use good judgment and common sense when following the suggested routes.</p><p><b>Emergency Services:</b> Do not rely on any navigation features included in the system to route you to emergency services. Ask local authorities or an emergency services operator for these locations. Not all emergency services such as police, fire stations, hospitals and clinics are likely to be contained in the map database for such navigation features.</p><p>Please read these terms and conditions carefully before you use the Telenav Software.
