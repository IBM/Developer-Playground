    "Summary": "addictive! but works for night coughing in dogs",
    "text": "my 12 year old sheltie has chronic brochotitis, been on meds for three years, these help with the coughing fits at night. so I like them!!!<br /> one bite and both my dogs are addicted!!! be warned!!! 7 pm both shelties are on my lap howling for the drug fix! I am a dog trainer and have never seen  anything like it....<br /><br />three weeks later,, the beloved sheltie got a bowel blockage from these, use with caution.<br />if the cat gets too many she has the runs....<br />sheltie did better when i upped her thryoid meds, and gave her doggie asthma meds.<br />so it worked better for the 18 year old cat, who also has asthma."
