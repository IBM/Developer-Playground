THese for seniors are wonderful. I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores."}
