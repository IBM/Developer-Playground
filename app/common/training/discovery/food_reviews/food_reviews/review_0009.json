So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth."}
