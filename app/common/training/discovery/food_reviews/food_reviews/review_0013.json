I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door."}
