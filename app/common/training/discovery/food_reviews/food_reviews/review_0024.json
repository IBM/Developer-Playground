They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say \"Time for your Greenies!\" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive."}
