I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else."}
