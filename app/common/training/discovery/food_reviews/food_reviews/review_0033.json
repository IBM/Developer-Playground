They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from \"green.\" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product."}
