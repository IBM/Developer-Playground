This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived.  The thing is, the box DID say it was the PETITE size on it!  After I opened the box, I found that it was the next size up and too big for my dogs to eat.  Now I have to try & cut these stinkers with a scissors each day!  I'm NOT happy...but I couldn't return them as I had opened the package.<br />I am afraid to order more, as the entire batch that Amazon has, may ALL be MIS-labled!"}
