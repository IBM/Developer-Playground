I think they almost look forward to me going to work now.  Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.<br /><br />Having shopped around, you are saving about ten dollars by ordering from Amazon rather than going into a big box pet store."}
