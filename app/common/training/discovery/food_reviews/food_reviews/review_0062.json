Limited to 1 a day. One of the few \"treats\" that he has not tired of. Also, his breath has been noticeably fresher since he has been having these. So far, best price on Amazon. The local pet food chains' sale prices has not yet come close to the regular price of these 96 count 'Teenie' packs. Can't vouch on the benefit of nutritional value of these, but the vet says our mini is in great shape ...right where he is suppose to be."}
