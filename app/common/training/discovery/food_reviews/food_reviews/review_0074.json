That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of brown-colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon."}
