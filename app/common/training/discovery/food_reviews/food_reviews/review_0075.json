Now as to do they work.  I honestly do not know.  Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!  I will come back and update this after their next check up which should be around August of 2013."}
