My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care (brushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's breath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh - inside the box is an airtight resealable bag."}
