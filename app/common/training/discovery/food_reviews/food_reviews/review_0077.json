I have found that my dogs love the Greenies and they do a good job of helping to keep the tarter build up off their teeth! I have one dog that is very particular about his treats and what he will chew on but he loves the Greenies, in fact my dogs will do most anything I ask so long as they know they get a Greenie afterwards!"}
