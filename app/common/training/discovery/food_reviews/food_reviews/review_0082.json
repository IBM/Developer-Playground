I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened!"}
