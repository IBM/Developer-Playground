We feed him the Jumbo size Greenies. He's 125+ pounds and devours them in seconds.  We order them from Amazon, because we can rarely find the Jumbo size greenie canisters in stores.  Our dog's teeth seem to be in really good condition.  We have never had any problems with him eating them or with his digestion.  We always give him one when we are around to watch and he's never had any issues."}
