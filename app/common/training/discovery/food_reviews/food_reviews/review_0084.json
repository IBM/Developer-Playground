I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item. Much cheaper on Amazon than at the pet store."}
