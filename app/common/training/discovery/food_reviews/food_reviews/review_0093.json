I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself."}
