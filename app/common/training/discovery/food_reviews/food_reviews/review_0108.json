The three best tasting brands were ONE, Vita Coco, and Zico.  Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula.  It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again."}
