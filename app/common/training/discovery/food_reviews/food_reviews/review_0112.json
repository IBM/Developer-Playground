I give my children coconut water instead of fruit juices because it is so much more nutritious, and we also drink it as a rehydrant when we are ill instead of Gatorade or Pedialyte.  We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids."}
