It really tastes bad.  I have all the rest sitting in my cabinet, never to be sipped by me.  When I am dead, I'm sure they will be thrown away.  I know, what do I mean by \"bad.\"  Well, I almost felt like I would get sick if I drank a whole bottle straight.  Maybe it is good for you, but the taste is so raunchy that I would have to be on a desert island to drink it."}
