It does not taste like an \"organic\" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the \"essence of mango\" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.<br /><br />I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either."}
