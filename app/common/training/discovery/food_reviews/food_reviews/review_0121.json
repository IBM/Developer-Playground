Those were metal lined, the juice was not from concentrate.  I just got a shipment of the new bottles, took a swig and almost spit it out.  Tastes like plastic.  I gave it a few more swigs, and now my stomach hurts.<br /><br />I immediately logged into Amazon so I could warn others not to buy this crap.  I'm closing the bottle, putting it back in the box and sending it all back to Amazon.  I will never buy Zico again.  YUCK!"}
