Then someone posted a not so good review from this same product in store and I was concerned.  Customer service said non-returnable item once shipped because it is considered perishable item.  My order just came, and boy am I ssooooooo DISAPPOINTED.  Smells funny, tastes salty.  Not same formulation.  Zico should have disclosed new formulation.  Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.  That brand was very comparable to the old Zico.<br /><br />I was a ZICO fan, but this new formulation just is grossly disappointing."}
