We were ordering via \"subscribe and save\" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the \"from concentrate\" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying \"top dollar\" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the \"liquid\" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our \"subscribe and save\" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will \"subscribe and save\" to another brand that uses the real stuff!"}
