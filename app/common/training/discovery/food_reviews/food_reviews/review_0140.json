My favorite flavor disappeared after ZICO sold out to Big Business, and my next favorite flavor since the sell out never seems to be available.  So I tried pineapple because it was available and I like another brand of coconut water with pineapple, but ZICO definitely did not nail this flavor!  I will choke down the rest of the nasty pineapple case and switch to something else...have lost faith in ZICO since they sold out."}
