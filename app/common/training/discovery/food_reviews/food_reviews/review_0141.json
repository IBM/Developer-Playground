Not so Tastey!","text":"Just got my order.. good thing.. nothing leaked like the Zico 33.8 Oz (6pack).<br />I've had about 5 so far.. have to say.. Vita Coco taste alot better. I do like the resealable packaging.. but, taste not so good.. as some reviewers said.. taste plasticy... I think I will stick with vita Coco."}
