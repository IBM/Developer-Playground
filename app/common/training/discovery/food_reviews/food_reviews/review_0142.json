It is a very<br />  convenient and economic way to order and receive the product at our doorsteps.  My<br />  wife especially likes the drink and enjoys it almost daily.<br /><br />  The taste is not quite the same as that of fresh coconut water, but it comes pretty close.<br />  If one feels really thirsty or dehydrated and looks for something other than plain water,<br />  this product could be very satisfying."}
