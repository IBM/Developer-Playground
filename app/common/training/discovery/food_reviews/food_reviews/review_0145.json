Their flavoring frequently is nasty.<br /><br />ZICO Coconut Water on the other hand is water with a pleasant coconut flavor and a natural blend of sugars and nutrients found within green coconuts. There's far less sodium than in other sports drinks, lots of potassium, and it can also be mixed with fruit juice to add some nice flavor to complement it (mango and orange are good additions).<br /><br />After raking leaves for a few hours in the hot Florida sun, this stuff not only tastes better, it seems to hydrate faster as well, I feel refreshed and ready for more work quicker than with the regular sports drinks."}
