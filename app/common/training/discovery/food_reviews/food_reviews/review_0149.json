I didn't enjoy it at all.","text":"I wanted to try this out because I've heard a lot of good things about Coconut Water and it sounded sweet and tasty.<br /><br />However...it's surprisingly bitter and not...very good at all. I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless, I highly recommend tasting a bit of it before you buy any large amount. It's probably an acquired taste, and not for me."}
