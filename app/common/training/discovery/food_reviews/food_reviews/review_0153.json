I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!"}
