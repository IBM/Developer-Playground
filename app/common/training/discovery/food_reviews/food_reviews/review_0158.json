We started her on it when she was 7 weeks old (and had about 4 teeth), and she loved it.  She was still too young to eat milk bones or even beggin' strips, but she could eat these.  I also don't feel bad about giving these to her because they are only 3.5 calories each. There is a rapid change in behavior when she hears me open up the treat bag... she sits, stops chewing, and starts randomly performing tricks, hoping to get one... it's pretty funny. We have repurchased these and will continue to do so."}
