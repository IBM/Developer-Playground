I have a 3 month old lab pup who, against type -- Labradors are supposed to be gobblers -- doesn't gobble his high quality kibble.  In fact, he grazes.  But when I unseal the package of Zuke's, he bounds at me bouncing in the air.  I taught him \"sit\" in two minutes using Zuke's (Chicken).  My 19 month old Catahoula Leopard Dog-girl loves them, too.<br /><br />I like the small size of these treats (it's easy to carry them in a snack size ziploc) -- perfect for training/rewards.  I pretty exclusively purchase natural, high quality food/treats for my animals companions.  Zuke's is our household's favorite canine treat!"}
