I've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small.  They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail.  Each piece has 3 calories.  For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy.  If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.<br /><br />The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed.  If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical."}
