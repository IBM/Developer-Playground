I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work. She loves these treats and has proved a quick study.  Happy treating!"}
