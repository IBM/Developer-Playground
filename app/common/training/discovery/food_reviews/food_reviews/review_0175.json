And the texture of the treats are pleasingly soft and moist. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I tried them. I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt. Also, they're a little small so it takes a lot to fill me up.<br /><br />On the other hand, my puppy loves these things and they have been great motivators for teaching her tricks, so I guess they have that going for them."}
