I guess I wasn't really paying attention when I ordered them, bc it looks like hamster food.  My dog still loves it.  I usually grab a small handful and throw them in her bowl.  She never complains.  that being said, here is my review from another order from this dog treat line.  It still applies to this product!<br />I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again."}
