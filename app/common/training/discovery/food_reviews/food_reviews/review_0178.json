I just stick a few in my back pocket, usually even break them into halves or thirds and use as treats. My dog loves them, and while she isn't the pickiest, she certainly doesn't like some treats. The real reason they are great though is because she likes them enough so that she will do her tricks for only a third of the treat! (This is an extremely tiny portion, which shows how flavorful they are.) And if they estimate correctly that's only one calorie of her diet! Can't go wrong, I've had chicken and salmon and both are great."}
