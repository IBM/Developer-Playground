There all natural. My pom mix has a very sensitive tummy and this treat does not bother him. As soon as I grab the bag my dogs try to do there tricks as fast as they can to get one of these. There soft in texture and the size is great for my 3 month old chi mix who is only 4 lbs. The only reason I gave this treat 4 stars is because they smell horrible other than that if you can deal with the smell. I recommend these! especially to anyone how has a small dog or a dog with a sensitive tummy!"}
