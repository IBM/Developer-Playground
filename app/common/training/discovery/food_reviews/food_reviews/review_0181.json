I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally."}
