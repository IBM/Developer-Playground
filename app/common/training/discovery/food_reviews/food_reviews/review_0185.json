My dog is 12 pounds and these are perfect for him. He loves soft treats and the stinkier the better so this is right up his alley. I have a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG\">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball, 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>and these treats are the perfect size for it. They roll out easily but not TOO easily so it keeps him busy for at least an hour. I got the chicken flavor and my dog thinks they're great. I love them because they are healthier for him than the other treats we'd been giving him and they are great to train with. I'm glad it comes in the 16 ounce bag because we go through them pretty quick!"}
