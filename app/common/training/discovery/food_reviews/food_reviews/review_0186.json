Thankfully this review is not the latter. When I initially got my puppy she was not house-trained, didn't know any tricks and was not food motivated. However, with these treats she was potty-trained and knows quite a few tricks. It was effort on my part, but those treats were definitely a good motivator. Also, looking around at other treats and their prices these are a really great value. If you want something that your dog will enjoy and a great value for the amount and type of treat this is what you want to look for. You and your dog won't be disappointed. I know mine isn't."}
