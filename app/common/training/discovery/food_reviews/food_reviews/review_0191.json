Rosemary and cherries?","text":"I have ordered these just a few times for our new puppy and recieved exactly the picture shown (the chicken flavor) but I just re-ordered a new bag and thought I was getting exactly what I had ordered previously but this one is slightly differt.  They have added 'anti-oxidents' to the recipe so it has cherry, rosmary and some other things added.  They are still the small round training treats and are still great (a little more calories at 3.5 per treat instead of 2) but I found it interesting that it wasn't as advertised by amazon.  Do they still sell the old ones or has Zuke's just changed their items?  FYI, I chose the '1 pound' option in the drop-down when I ordered.<br />I still give this 5 stars because I think they are the best treats out there for training, they are small, moist, stinky (that's good for dogs) and made with healthy quality ingredients.  Just not sure if Zuke's changed them or if I was sent something slightly different by accient.  I guess I will find out next time I try to order them!"}
