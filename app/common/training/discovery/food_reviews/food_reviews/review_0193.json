They're great for having on hand just as treats or as rewards while working on training.  You can carry alot and it not be awkward.<br /><br />He loves the chicken flavor and can't seem to get enough.  I love the price for the size of the bag you get and they last a good while as long as you ration.  Even though they are definitely \"mini\", each one has such a strong (not overwhelming) aroma and taste that just that little morsel is enough for our big guy.  His nose knows.<br /><br />I'm ordering more today and will continue to order as long as they're available.  Just wish they were on auto delivery.  We'd never want to run out.  Any other treat just won't do.  I highly recommend you at least try them.  You and your pooch will be glad you did."}
