No cutting needed even for smaller dogs.<br />Dogs love. I haven't met one that doesn't like it. My dog is picky about treats.<br />They smell but like salmon, nothing offensive.<br />Low in calorie so you don't need to worry when training.<br /><br />CONS:<br />They dry out. I ended up storing them in an airtight container.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />It's a treat my dog loves and it's not harming her and I don't have to deal with cutting it down. I wish I had these when we were doing puppy class and going through a ton of treats nightly."}
