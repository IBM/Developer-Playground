They smell ridiculously strong which is a good thing since my dog knows she's getting a treat whenever I open the bag. I'm planning to try all the other flavors from this company! I tried them with a 3 mo beagle puppy and an adult German shepherd and they adored these too so I know they're great for all sizes."}
