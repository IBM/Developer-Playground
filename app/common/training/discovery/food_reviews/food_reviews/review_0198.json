I found these mini treats, and the bag had awesome reviews from a good amount of people. The treats weren't pricey at all, and I went ahead and bought them. My dog absolutely loves these. They're moist, small, and perfect for training. She listens so well when I bring these out, and she hasn't gotten tired of them at all. She's perfected two new tricks on top of repeating her old ones in just a matter of one day! The only negative I would say is that they do have a particular smell since they are very moist and natural. Overall, these treats are a huge success!"}
