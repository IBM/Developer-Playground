They tend to have a very strong fish oil smell. So if you are afraid of the fishy smell, don't get it. But I think my dog likes it because of the smell. These treats are really small in size. They are great for training. You can give your dog several of these without worrying about him over eating. Amazon's price was much more reasonable than any other retailer. You can buy a 1 pound bag on Amazon for almost the same price as a 6 ounce bag at other retailers. It's definitely worth it to buy a big bag if your dog eats them a lot."}
