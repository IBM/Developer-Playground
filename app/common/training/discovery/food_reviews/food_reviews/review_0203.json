Luckily we found Zuke's right away!  There is no beef, wheat, or corn in them.  With their small size (about the size of a pencil eraser) and moist texture, they are the best for training and reinforcing good behavior.  We've tried the chicken, peanut butter, and salmon flavors, and the salmon are definitely her favorite.  Next up - I think I'll get the rabbit flavor for her to try!"}
