We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for \"pee\" rewards and larger ones of another brand for \"poo\" rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!"}
