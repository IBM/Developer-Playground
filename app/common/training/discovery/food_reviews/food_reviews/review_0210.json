He expects them before he goes to sleep for the evening, and often looks for them when we just tell him he is as good boy.  When we run out of them he actually pouts because now he expects them every day.  What I like about these treats for our dog is that they are natural, no chemicals, and just the right size for our dog to chew (he is 28 lbs.).  Also, some of the proceeds go toward Cancer Research for animals, which I am all for since we lost a Jack Russell to cancer at the age of 5 (Lymphoma).  Very sad to see an animal suffer with Cancer, as with a human, and also to lose them, which is especially emotionally stressful.  We will purchase Zukes as long as our dog loves them - and we know this will be for his life."}
