My dog seems to love this things. They do stink when you open the box so beware. I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot."}
