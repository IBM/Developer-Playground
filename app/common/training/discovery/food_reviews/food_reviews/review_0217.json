Intlehouse \"Star's Mom\"","HelpfulnessNumerator":50,"HelpfulnessDenominator":53,"Score":5,"date":"2008-08-03","Summary":"Our Dogs LOVE These and We Do Too!","text":"I have been feeding our dogs Greenie bones since they first came out and we have NEVER had a problem.  I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a \"garbage belly\" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the \"green\" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where \"E. Antic\" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are \"deadly\", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up \"NYLABONES\"?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie \"Smart Biscuits\" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!"}
