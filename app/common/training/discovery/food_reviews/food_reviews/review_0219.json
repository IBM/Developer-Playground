She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them."}
