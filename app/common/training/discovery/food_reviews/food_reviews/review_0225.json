He has a very sensitive stomach and can only have boiled chicken and canned and dry prescription diet ID<br />I brush his teeth every night and afterwards he gets a \"greenie\"  he loves them and I love that they don't upset his stomach.<br />Our Vet said they should be ok for Pepper.  And they are.  Paying about 40.00 elsewhere, I'm really happy to find them on Amazon.com for a little over half of that.  Pepper is happy and I'm happy."}
