She does not seem to tire of these unlike many treats she has tried.<br />I have heard that the official word is that these do not really promote good breath.<br />Maybe they just limit the amount of bad breath. Whatever. This box is a three<br />month supply so is a reasonably economical way to give my dog something she really likes."}
