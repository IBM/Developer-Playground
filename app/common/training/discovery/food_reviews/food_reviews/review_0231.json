It reeked like a dead fish, and I couldn't handle her puppy kisses any more.  Then, I saw an ad on TV for a competing product, but found these to be a better deal. They are worth every penny.<br /><br />The Teenie Greenies arrived yesterday. Just ONE solved the problem. I gave it to her half expecting her to turn her nose up. Instead, she loved it. This morning she greeted me with sloppy kisses and wiggles. I instinctively cringed, waiting for that fetid smell. But there was NO smell! Zilch. Zip. Nada."}
