She ended up loving them,so I kept the small zip-lock pouch the sample size came in. I just take about 20 of the Greenies at a time from the large 96 chews container and refill the zip-lock pouch.*It also is a great way to bring some Greenies along with you when you are traveling with your dog!<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQCJIG\">Greenies Treats for Dogs (5-15 lbs/2-7 kg)Mini Treat-Pak-Teenie 6 oz</a>"}
