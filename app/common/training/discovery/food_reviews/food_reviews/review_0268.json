However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that."}
