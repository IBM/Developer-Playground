I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the \"risk\" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!"}
