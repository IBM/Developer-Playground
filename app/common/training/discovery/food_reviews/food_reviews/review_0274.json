She is a mix between 1/4 poodle, chihuahua, terrier, and maltese. She is SUPER picky with treats and food in general and she absolutely loves these!! She wants one all the time! Her bowel movements are not affected by them in a negative way. The only thing I would say that is a con is that they don't last very long! She eats them pretty quickly even though the material of them is pretty rock solid and her mouth is tiny."}
