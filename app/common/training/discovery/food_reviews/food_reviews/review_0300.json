My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.  His top part is huge but his legs- not so much.  Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here."}
