It's very strong, but not bitter or burnt--it's just plain great coffee.  I wish I had invented this cheaper version of a k-cup, because this design is genius.  Out of 15 of my cups of this coffee so far, only one had a coffee ground in it--just one little piece.<br /><br />This is best with just cream, it's just plain luxurious!  Thanks SF Bay Coffee!"}
