I thought it was a strong brew. Comparable to Tulleys house blend, emerils. Stronger than newmans. They also were easy to empty out and re-use the container with my own ground coffee. I use the glad press and seal to keep the coffee in.  You just have to make sure the wrap is on taut so the needle pokes through. If its too loose the needle won't puncture and the water all spills over the top, Big Mess!  Good morning brew. Will buy again."}
