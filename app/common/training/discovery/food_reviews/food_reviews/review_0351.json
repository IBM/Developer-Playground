My first cup (medium setting) was off-putting at best. I brewed my second cup on the small-cup setting, hoping for a bolder and richer flavour and mouth feel; none was forthcoming. I appreciate the less plastic packaging and don't find it a bad flavor - I personally don't find the intense boodness I look forward to in a cup of coffee."}
