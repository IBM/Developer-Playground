Years ago I used to drink Starbucks French Roast.  Loved the taste but it just tore my stomach up and it was very acidic. I was hesitant to try another Starbucks but love vanilla flavor so I thought I would give it a try.  If you are used to drinking flavored coffees, you won't taste much vanilla...just a hint.  Very smooth and overall good taste.<br /><br />The ingredients on the side of the package says:  Ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root.  Also on the bag it says, \"To preserve that fresh just roasted flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in a cabinet (not the refrigerator) and brew within a week of opening.\"<br /><br />Overall I liked it.  If you want a coffee with just a hint of flavor, I would recommend this.  However, if you are used to lattes loaded with milk, cream, sugar and other flavorings, you probably won't taste much of a difference between this and unflavored coffee."}
