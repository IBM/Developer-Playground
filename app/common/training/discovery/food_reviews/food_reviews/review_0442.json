The flavor just wasn't there. It has some vanilla flavor but not what i would expect from this brand of coffee. I think I will stick to my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC\">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a> added to regular coffee. Then I can adjust the taste to my mood."}
