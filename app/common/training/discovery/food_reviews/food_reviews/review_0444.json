This coffee does not brew very strong, and is also bitter.  I've found this to be true of most arabica blends.  The beans have the aroma of vanilla, but the vanilla flavor was very subtle.  I think this coffee would be okay for someone who doesn't like their coffee very strong.  But, if you like a good, strong cup of coffee, I would avoid this one."}
