But the addition of vanilla can make just about any coffee palatable, and since this had the Starbucks name on it, I figured it was worth a try.<br /><br />But I couldn't really taste the vanilla. Overall, this coffee just didn't impress me as either bad or good. It just sort of sat there. Maybe it has to do with my coffee-making skills, but I don't know why the vanilla flavor wouldn't come through."}
