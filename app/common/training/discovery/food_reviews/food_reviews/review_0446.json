The flavor was uniquely pleasant and very gentle in taste.  I was wondering if Starbucks would be interested in that kind of coffee.<br /><br />When I received Natural Fusions, I was pleasantly surprised to be brought back to the highlands of Southwestern China that I just got back from.  I don't know where this coffee is from, but I am quite sure it is a similar kind of beans.<br /><br />I am glad that Starbucks doesn't infuse too much extra flavor, in this case vanilla, to overpower the natural taste of this coffee.  If you like the usual bold and strong Starbucks coffee, you might not like this one.<br /><br />But I think this coffee is quite safe for entertaining guests that you don't know what they would like for coffee because it won't turn anyone off by it's fine, gentle, and somewhat classy flavor.<br /><br />Just like drinking green tea, which is always mild, but the joy is in savoring its fine natural quality."}
