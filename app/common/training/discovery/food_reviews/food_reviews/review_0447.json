I've enjoyed this Starbucks Natural Fusions, Vanilla so very much.  It has just the right amount of bite, sweetness, and beautiful aroma.  It's a very fine grind, and it was perfect for my French Press, which I find to be the best way to get that perfect cup of coffee.  Starbucks has done it again with this beautiful combination.  I've found my go-to coffee!  Thanks Starbucks!!"}
