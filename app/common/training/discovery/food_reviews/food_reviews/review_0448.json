It has been a good investment. And it includes a doodad that allows one to use something other than specially made \"K-cups\" (coffee containers explicitly designed for the coffee maker). I had earlier purchased this coffee, thinking to use it in my old Mr. Coffee machine (which never created the kind of taste that I wanted).<br /><br />However, in a Keurig machine, this works pretty well. I am still calibrating how much coffee should go in the container for brewing. One rather odd observation: There is not much vanilla fragrance when one opens the package; there is also not much of a fragrance when it is brewing. But when I drink a cup, the vanilla flavir is there.<br /><br />So, in the end, I find this a nice complement to my Keurig machine. I'm pretty satisfied, although the taste is still not as robust as I would like (but I am still experimenting on how much coffee to use, so this may resolve)."}
