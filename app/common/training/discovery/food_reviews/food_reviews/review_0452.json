Some flavored coffees I have tried miss the mark and the additional flavoring covers up the coffee flavor.  This had just the right light vanilla flavor along with a nice, smooth coffee flavor.  If you are someone who likes a stronger flavor, this product might not be for you.  Personally, I really ejnoyed it and would recommend it."}
