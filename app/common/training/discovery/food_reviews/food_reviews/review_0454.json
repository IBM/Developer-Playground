Sometimes I feel like I'm drinking from an ashtray on their very dark roast.<br /><br />The vanilla taste (and smell) are more prominent than in many flavored coffees, which again, for me, was a good thing. Though not overwhelming, you definitely could tell this was a vanilla flavored coffee.<br /><br />Nice fresh/consistant flavor through the whole bag."}
