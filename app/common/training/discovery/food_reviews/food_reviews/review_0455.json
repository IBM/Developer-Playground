We just have the basic, Mr Coffee with a 12-cup carafe. It's really impossible to duplicate the flavor you get at the coffee bars when basic home equipment. That said, this coffee emerged full, rich, strong and most importantly, without that nauseating taste some flavored coffees have. My daughter and I are both coffee lovers and were both pleased."}
