I stick with book reviews...but I drink a lot of coffee when I'm reading and reviewing books.  So...this one was special.  I made my first pot and upon smelling the coffee, I was hooked. How good is it? I haven't tossed the ground coffee package yet!  It's empty, but it still smells good and reminds me of those morning smiles and good books.  Way to go, Starbucks!"}
