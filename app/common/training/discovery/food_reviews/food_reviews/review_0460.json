In terms of it's roast, this did not disappoint, so for you milder coffee drinkers, this might be a bit bolder in flavor for you.  That said, the dark roast with the added vanilla flavor didn't seem to fuse so well for me.  Instead of both flavors working harmoniously, it was like dropping a dash of vanilla extract to my french roast in the morning.  One flavor, followed by the vanilla aftertaste.  My local store carries this at 11 oz, and a starbucks typical roast at 12 oz for pretty much the same price.  So we're talking an ounce difference price wise.  The fusions coffee comes only ground, so it doesn't work for the french press users, and I just wasn't impressed.  Not horrible, but not worth coming back for more."}
