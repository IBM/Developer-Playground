Not because I dont like a little flavor in my coffee but because most companies use flavored oils and inferior beans and are often very bitter. This caught my eye because the flavors are in their natural form ground with the coffee. I thought I would give it a shot and LOVE it. The coffee alone is a good quality coffee and the suttle vanilla flavor really comes out when you add a small amount of cream and sweetner. It's not my daily coffee but I always look forward to drinking it!"}
