That said, surprisingly, I really like this coffee.  It still has some of the strong, Starbucks coffee flavor that some really like, but it is nicely mellowed with the vanilla flavor.  The vanilla is not crazy strong, but if you don't like flavored coffee, you won't like this.  I found it to be a great morning coffee.  I drink it with half and half and like the smooth, creamy, vanilla taste."}
