The aroma while it is brewing is outstanding and it really delivers once you take a drink.  The vanilla flavor is strong, but not overpowering, the coffee has a nice full taste.  I have served this to a few friends and they all loved it as well.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice flavored coffee!"}
