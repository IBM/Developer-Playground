I'm a coffee lover and must have one every each day.  Anyways, i thought giving this coffee a try.  I must admit, i'm not sure what they mean by \"natural fusion\", but it sure does taste good. It's nice and smooth with sutble taste of vanilla. I personally like bolder taste of coffee and this coffee seems more bold."}
