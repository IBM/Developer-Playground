I only drink it when I'm tired. So I thought this would be nice to try since it has a little bit of vanilla flavor in it to make it taste better. So I would have to say it taste pretty good for coffee, but if you're expecting it to take taste like vanilla Frapuccino, you will be disappointed :-) . It has a nice light flavor of vanilla in it to give your coffee a unique taste."}
