Will buy again.","text":"I ordered this coffee at at good price, not for the name. But both my husband and I were surprised that we really did enjoy the flavor and aroma without noticing a bitter after-taste. We are by no means coffee experts, we just drink our morning cup to get us going. We've tried different brands and don't usually give much care either way, except for flavored coffees which we usually avoid due to bitterness. They always smell so nice, but the taste, yuck. So maybe there is something to the Starbucks brand, it was good coffee, and I'll have to try some other flavors to see if they stand up to our taste testing as well.<br /><br />I should note that we make our coffee using an aero press which helps in taking much of the bitter taste out of coffee and we usually drink our coffee with just skim milk."}
