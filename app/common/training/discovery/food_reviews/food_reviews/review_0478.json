There is a very small hint of vanilla flavor that did NOT have a chemical taste.  However, I would have preferred more of a vanilla flavoring as opposed to the minute amount in this coffee.  All in all, this is a good coffee that is not bitter.  I would recommend it to coffee drinkers but not to those who are looking for a burst of additional flavor."}
