I was excited when I saw a deal featuring their new Natural Fusions Ground Coffee on Amazon.<br /><br />I placed my order and (because of Prime) got it in two days. The first thing I noticed was the intense vanilla smell. I could smell it through the bag. After opening the coffee and making a bit, I was expecting an almost over-powering vanilla taste, not the case.<br /><br />I could only taste a hint of vanilla in the coffee.  That was OK, but I was hoping for a bit more.  Over-all, it is a good tasting coffee that has a decent boldness. While I prefer non-flavored coffee, I will admit, this coffee tastes pretty good and makes a strong consideration for future purchases. Especially if I can get it on sale."}
