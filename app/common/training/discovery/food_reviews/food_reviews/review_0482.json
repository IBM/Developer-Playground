More like Vanilla extract,it really is very lightly flavored compared to regular Starbucks, it could be called Starbucks lite. It has a very pleasent taste but weak. I think if you use a bit more than the usual amount it has a more powerful kick but still not Starbucks par. You can taste a slight Vanilla flavor still not nearly as strong as other flavored coffee I have tried, still very pleasent and tasty though. Not sure I would buy this varity for myself. I like mine a little stronger. If you like a weaker flavored coffee, then you will like this."}
