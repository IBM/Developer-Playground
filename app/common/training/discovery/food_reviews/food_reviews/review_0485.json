If you follow the instructions you won't notice any difference from the coffe yu buy at the starbucks shops and this home made brew.<br />Highly recommended for people that don't have the time to wait in line, have harsh climate in their area or, like in my case, that live out of the continental US.<br />I also recommend this coffe for everyone that wants to enjoy life!"}
