That said, I did enjoy this product more than I thought I would. I chose it as a change of pace over my usual dark roasted plain coffees. The vanilla flavoring is subtle, natural-tasting, and doesn't leave much of an after taste as many flavored coffees do. It's a lot more affordable on Amazon now, but when I received it, it was way over priced. Starbucks coffee is always over-priced (in my opinion) but this stuff was crazy expensive at first.<br /><br />Definitely recommended if you are a flavored coffee lover, and can get it at a fair price. I just ordered some of the cinnamon variety and can't wait to give it a taste, too."}
