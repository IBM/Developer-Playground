I love vanilla more than chocolate so I thought this was going to be great, and I drink Starbucks all the time. I found however that the smell was better than the taste. Once I added sugar, it seemed to be better, but I normally don't add sugar in my coffee. It also seemed as though there was an odd aftertaste. The coffee was okay, but I think I'll stick with my regular Breakfast blend."}
