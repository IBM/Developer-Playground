Known for it's consistency, quality and boldness Starbucks company keeps pleasing me (and my taste buds) with every coffee variety.  Although I was a bit reluctant to try this \"Flavored\" coffee, it is done really well.  I was expecting sweet, but it is just coffee, bold, delightful coffee, infused with vanilla.  It produces a wonderful aroma when you wake up or works well when mixed with a liqueur for a dessert cocktail."}
