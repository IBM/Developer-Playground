In the case of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee this is NOT the case.  The coffee is just as good as what you'd get at their shop (though you do have to make it yourself) with a rich and fragrant vanilla taste. Following the recipe as listed, yields a great cup of coffee (which I have not always found to be the case when I purchase brand name coffee - I often have to \"fiddle\" with the guidelines to produce something close to what I get at their restaurant/shop).  The bag came very compressed and wrinkled and I was initially worried that this would impact its taste but we've made multiple cups since opening up the bag and each has been delicious and the bag itself does the usual job of keeping the product fresh (though I doubt we'll have it for long as good as it is).  If you like Starbucks and/or vanilla coffee, this is a product for you."}
