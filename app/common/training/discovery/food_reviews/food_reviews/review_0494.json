I really did.  I brewed it a cup at a time, a pot at a time, by drip, Chemex, and French press.  Each and every time, it was a no go for me.<br /><br />For the record, I like my coffee strong and black.  I'm sure that if you add a lot of sugar and cream, this would be just fine.<br /><br />But for coffee purists, pass this one by."}
