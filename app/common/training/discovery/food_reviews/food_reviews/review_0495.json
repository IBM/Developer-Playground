You know its different but you don't know why ... and then it hits you. It's GOOD! Not overpowering like some flavored coffees; this one has just a hint of flavor and I think it makes it better.<br /><br />I brought this into work and shared it with colleagues; it quickly became one of our favorite blends. Not bitter at all, yet not weak at all either. A nice, smooth blend perfect for relaxing mornings as well as at work. I will be ordering more."}
