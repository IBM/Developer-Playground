I prefer to add vanilla syrup to regular (Verona) coffee. However, this was a nice change. The vanilla flavor wasn't overwhelming and it was a true vanilla-not perfumey or artificial. I still had to add a little sugar and a splash of cream to make it to my taste but I enjoyed it. The aroma when it was brewing was terrific."}
