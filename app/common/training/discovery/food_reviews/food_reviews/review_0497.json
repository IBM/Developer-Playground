This one is great. It has just enough vanilla to be flavored, but not too much to overpower. This does brew up quite strong, almost as strong as espresso with one tablespoon coffee to one cup of water. However, it's great for my purposes. I've developed an addiction to adding it to warm milk and brown sugar for a vanilla and brown sugar latte (I froth my milk by shaking it up in a jar and microwaving it).  I bet I can't get it that way at Starbucks, but that's okay because I can make it at home just fine ... and cheaper."}
