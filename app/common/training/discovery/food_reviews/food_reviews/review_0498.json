A cup of Folger's is a perfectly fine cup of coffee but it's the Little League compared to Starbucks.  When we stop at a Starbucks' coffee shop, we know that we'll be paying a good deal more for the coffee -- but we're glad (?) to do so.  It's really fine coffee.  And so too with this 11-ounce package of ground coffee -- the price is more than a bit higher than the regular coffees.  And the taste, especially this one with the strong hint of vanilla, is better too.<br /><br />So treat yourself at home.  Buy the packaged ground Starbucks coffee and get that same great taste."}
