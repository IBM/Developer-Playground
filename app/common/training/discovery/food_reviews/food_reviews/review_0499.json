That being said, I rarely drink flavored coffees but do like them once in a while as a change of pace. When I drink these types of coffees, I prefer to flavoring to be light so that it does not overwhelm the natural coffee flavor. This product almost achieves that balance but the vanilla is just a bit too strong for my taste, hence only 4 stars. If you prefer the flavoring to be a little stronger than I do, then you will love this coffee. It's very robust and flavorful and it smells fantastic while brewing."}
