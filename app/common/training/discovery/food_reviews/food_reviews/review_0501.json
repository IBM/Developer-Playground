From a pure coffee perspective, I really enjoyed the rich, medium-strength taste of this finely-ground coffee. It's not quite your local fresh-brewed, but still very good for my average drip coffee maker.<br /><br />Most flavored coffees just blow you over with aroma and flavor, so I find the subtlety  Starbucks Natural Fusions refreshing. But, if you're really looking for a vanilla-flavored coffee, you might want to look elsewhere - it's that subtle.<br /><br />Of course, the cost is more than your run-of-the-mill coffee in a plastic crate. But for me, the difference in taste and quality is worth it. I've ordered more!"}
