Subtle is the key","text":"The nice thing about vanilla is that it is subtle.  Unlike other flavors often used in coffees (cinnamon, fall spices, etc.) vanilla is not meant to be a strong flavor.  It is truly their to compliment the coffee.  The vanilla flavor is very natural and takes the edge off the coffee.  The smoothness of the coffee does not overpower the vanilla, and the flavors do not seem to be competing for space on your palette.  I would recommend this coffee as an enjoyable break from your everyday blend."}
