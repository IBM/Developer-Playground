You could still taste the Starbucks coffee and I like that, but that's because I like regular coffee. If you're a flavored coffee drinker and you prefer the flavor over the coffee taste, this may not be the one for you.<br />Since I do not typically drink flavored coffee the ingredient list still left me a little uneasy..although \"natural\"(which really has such a loose, if any, definition when used in labeling food)the ingredients were just things I was not used to seeing listed on a coffee package.<br />They were, in order listed:<br /> Ground Coffee, Natural Flavor (with Corn Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin), Ground Vanilla Beans, Indidan Sarsaparilla Root<br />So, more \"natural flavor\" than actual vanilla beans. Also, glad I checked before serving this coffee to a close friend of mine who has corn allergies.<br />A plus I discovered while examining the bag, it says if you bring the empty bag in to one of the US Starbucks stores they'll exchange it for a free 12oz coffee (within 30days of the \"best Before\" date). :)"}
