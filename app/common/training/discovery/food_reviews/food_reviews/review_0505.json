It seems like the special flavor disappears once they are brewed.  And, I have to admit, I threw out the first pot I brewed of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla because it was too bland.  So when I made the next pot, I added an extra tablespoon of coffee and that made all the difference.  The vanilla scent is very natural and not perfume-y, and the vanilla flavor is nice, but not overpowering.  Add a little milk and sugar and it's a special treat.  I much prefer this to the VIA vanilla packets which, although more convenient, are too strong-flavored and too sweet for me.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like flavored coffee that is subtle, but well-balanced, this is a good one to purchase.  Just be prepared to add an extra tablespoon or so when you make it."}
