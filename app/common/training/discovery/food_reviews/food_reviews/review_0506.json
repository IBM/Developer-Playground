Depending upon your taste, you can enjoy a stronger brew or reduce the amount of coffee you use. I simply use a bit less coffee.  I was skeptical about this coffee as I find Starbucks coffee at the local stores has a burnt taste to it lately and I avoid their coffee in general.  This is a nice rich coffee and there is no hint of burnt coffee flavor."}
