My husband, who usually doesn't care for \"regular\" Starbucks (unlike me) did like this coffee. I actually switched his out (Duncan Donuts) and he noticed it was different but said he really enjoyed it. As for me, I really prefer this to the VIA style with the sugar added, this is much more robust and stands well in an expresso. Nice product, I may give it as a gift for my coffee buddies!"}
