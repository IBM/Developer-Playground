It is not because I don't like them but it is because I usually have my coffee at home.  Their product is actually pretty good from the few times I have been to one of their stores.  This product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees.  Light as I like it, but very flavorful, it is a nice way to start the day.  Don't shy away from it because it has a \"chain restaurant\" brand, it is actually pretty good."}
