Good coffee, either way.","text":"I admit, I'm not a huge Starbucks coffee fan (yes, there are those of out there who aren't), but I do enjoy flavored coffees, so looked forward to trying this Natural Fusions Vanilla-Flavored Ground Coffee from Starbucks. I thoroughly enjoyed the coffee, but I do question whether it is actually \"vanilla\" flavored or hazelnut. It tasted no different from the Hazelnut coffees I buy, and I didn't get a sense of vanilla from it at all. That aside, the coffee was robust and had a natural taste to it. Measurements for my coffee maker were the same as regular coffee, which is a positive since I often have flavored coffees that require extra coffee to get a deep coffee flavor. I did not rate this coffee 5 star because the flavoring was so deep that it actually flavored my thermal carafe, and that flavor stayed for 5 or 6 more pots of \"regular\" coffee, despite being washed out thoroughly after each use. Overall, I think hazelnut coffee lovers will love this coffee, though vanilla coffee lovers might be surprised at the hazelnut flavor! Good coffee and I will buy more for those nights when a special cup of coffee is just right."}
