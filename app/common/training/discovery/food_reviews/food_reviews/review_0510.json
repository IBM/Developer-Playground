Me, I'm more of a \"McDonalds\" type coffee drinker because I have found it to be a weak coffee, which is perfect for me. I wanted to try this Starbucks vanilla because I like the smell of vanilla. So I brewed it at home, and drank a bit. Personally, it was too strong for me, though the vanilla flavor was subtle and a nice touch. I added more milk than usual, and that seemed to help.<br /><br />Am I giving up my McDonalds coffee? No, but that's no fault of the Starbucks vanilla. I prefer my coffee less strong, that's just me!"}
