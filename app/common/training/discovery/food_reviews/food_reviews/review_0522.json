To me, it tastes like a black tea; I hardly taste the ginger at all, and it's not as pepperminty as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I realize tastes are just so personal, but that's how I view it anyway.<br /><br />Oh, you should know that it comes in a regular box (as pictured) and not in a tea box at all. So, you will want a cannister, tea tin, or something to put it in.<br /><br />In the meantime, I do like the White Tea with Pear.."}
