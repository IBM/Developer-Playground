Pleased to find it on Amazon for a steal & w/ free shipping!<br /><br />I've been drinking Peppermint tea for years & this one has the very best flavor I've experienced.  I usually enjoy my tea sweetened w/ a little honey but took some to my skinny sis who lives without honey & was suprised @ how delicious this was even without any sweetener:)<br /><br />The first time I ordered this I ordered it packaged in (6), 20 count boxes which was great b/c when running out to someone's house for dinner or a visit I could grab a box to give as a modest hostess gift.<br /><br />This time ordered the box of 100 b/c of the significant value!<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this as much as I do."}
