I started drinking tea because of the health benefits, but I didn't really care for it. Then I found Stash's Green Chai, which I started to really enjoy. Then I found the White Chai, which is even better, and apparently has even more antioxidants and health benefits than the green. A cup every morning starts my workday off right. I am excited to find this good deal on the large package."}
