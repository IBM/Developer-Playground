But the description says \"Foodservice packaging, dispenser opening\" but that's not the case at all. You get a box, full of single serve metal pouch tea. That's it, no dispenser opening, no foodservice packaging.<br /><br />Just be sure to understand that you are getting a box full tea bags and that's all."}
