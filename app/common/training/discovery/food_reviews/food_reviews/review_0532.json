I got really annoyed by all the packaging, so I was extremely happy when I saw this 100-count box.<br /><br />That's ALL you get: one small box filled with 100 individually wrapped tea bags. The box doesn't come in a box, how awesome is that?! Also, no more fighting with the plastic wrap and filling your recycling bin with hundreds of flimsy little Stash boxes.<br /><br />The tea itself is delicious. Very earthy, clean and slightly grassy. It reminds me of the green tea you get in real Japanese restaurants, but a bit less grassy (which I like).<br /><br />Decaf is perfect if you want hot tea during the evening."}
