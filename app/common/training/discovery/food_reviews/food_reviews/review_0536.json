I love Autumn and the scent and flavor of this tea reminds me so much of everything I love about Autumn.  The spices are perfect to give an excellent aroma and flavor...In my opinion, this is the perfect beverage to have as you curl up with a good book on a cool afternoon, or to enjoy as a delicious dinnertime tea.  I like to drink it with raw, unprocesed cane sugar.  I feel the cane sugar gives this tea even more the taste of a special chilly-weather treat.  I plan to drink this tea as my after dinner drink each evening, and will definitely be purchasing it again and again.  Kudos to you, Stash...and kudos to Amazon for having such a great price."}
