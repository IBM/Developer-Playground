My favorite is the fusion green and white tea though. I bought the box of tea cause it was a GREAT price for such a large quantity. I'm very happy with the purchase, and recommend trying Stash tea to anyone. I also LOVE doing business with Amazon cause they always have great low prices. I recommend Amazon.com to all as well."}
