I normally don't enjoy fruit flavored teas.  This one is a great flavor, but I have noticed it needs to steep longer to get enough flavor out of it.  The raspberry is a little too subtle.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the small white packet shown with the box) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets. If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />If you are interested in a full-flavor tea, I highly recommend Stash's White Christmas Tea."}
