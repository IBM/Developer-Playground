Hershey's anyone?","text":"I tell everyone I know to buy this tea.  It's the ONLY chocolate tea I've found that actually tastes like chocolate!  It's not overwhelming and although I'm not normally a fan of hazelnut, it really only serves to act as a flavor enhancer to the chocolate.  It's just awesome, hands down, not weak either, although it is decaf.  The price here is a bit high - you can get this in the store that begins and ends with a t here in the States for about two dollars and a quarter for the 18 bag size.  Great, incredible stuff, I'm almost out again!  Highly, highly recommend!"}
