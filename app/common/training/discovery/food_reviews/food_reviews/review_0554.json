Generally, I don't like chai teas; they are too harsh of a taste for me.  To me, the taste is similar to Good Earth's original blend, a gentle spiced tea with tastes like cinnamon and nutmeg.  I have drunk this one for quite awhile since I discovered Stash teas after going on vacation in Oregon (where they are based).  So, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and even be able to automatically order it. Keep carrying it, Amazon!"}
