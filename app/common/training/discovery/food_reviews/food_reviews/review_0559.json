I went back and bought a ton of it because it immediately became my favorite tea. I love the peppermint & ginger and I love the fresh new bud taste of white tea, over green tea leaves (Same plant, different part). This tea has it all. Mildly spicy, and smooth yet refreshing. I practically live on herbal teas and have tried lots of different ones. This is my number one all time favorite!"}
