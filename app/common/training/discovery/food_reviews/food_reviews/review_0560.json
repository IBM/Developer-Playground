Furthermore; it has lots of other ingredients although the title leads you to believe otherwise.<br /><br />It has raspberry leaf, hibiscus, strawberry FLAVOR, licorice powder... a very complex blend in my opinion; considering they lead you to believe it is: GOJI BERRY, MATCHA and GREEN TEA.<br /><br />Goji berries are full of nutrients and antioxidants. WHAT THE HECK IS \"GOJI FLAVOR\" and why does the heading on the front of the teabag state it is goji berry when it is not?<br /><br />WAY TOO SWEET in addition. A true mislead and disappointment. Shame on them.<br /><br />How can they have the audacity to call the teabag 100% Natural Ingredients? What is goji flavor and strawberry flavor? Tastes terrible."}
