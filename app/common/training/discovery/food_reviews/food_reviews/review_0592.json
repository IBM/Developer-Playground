Tried several different K-Cup coffees until I found the Fog Chaser. Now I have it on my subscribe and save list. I have it sent to my office, my home, my son's home every month. It ain't Kona but it is almost as bold, the aroma fills the kitchen in the morning and that first sip is great every time.<br />And at 1/2 the price of the Kona, it is the \"best bang for the buck\". I'll never go back."}
