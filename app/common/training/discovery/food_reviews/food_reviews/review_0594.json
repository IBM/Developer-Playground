They are shaped differently on the bottom which other reviews had mentioned. They fit perfectly into my coffee maker and it looks as though there is less plastic waste than the other k-cups I have seen.<br /><br />I like strong, full bodied flavor- so does my husband- and we were both extremely happy with this find.<br />I am going to see if there is a way to get set up for monthly auto delivery.<br /><br />I will order from this merchant again...and again...and again."}
