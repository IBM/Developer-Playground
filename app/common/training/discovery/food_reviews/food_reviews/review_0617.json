I love the fact that the San Francisco Bay coffee cups for Keurig brewers do not have the typical plastic containers. I hate throwing away all that plastic. I tried washing out those little containers but that was such a pain! So these coffee containers make much more sense. The coffee tastes great and the aroma is even better than the original Keurig cups. This is a good alternative and a fantastic price."}
