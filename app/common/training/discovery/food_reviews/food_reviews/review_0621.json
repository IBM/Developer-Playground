A bold flavor with that touch of nuttiness that I prefer.  We compost and was hoping for something totally compostable that could simply be thrown in the bin. This is much preferable to the old K-cups but still the plastic top remains for the trash.  I see no reason why a fully compostable product could not be developed."}
