These \"soft bottom cups\" allow easier brewing and I think they make a stronger coffee. I like the decaf brew, and my husband loves the Fog Chaser. The only down side is they are not sealed, they have a soft filter bottom and they need to be stored in an airtight container, but who cares if it's cheaper and tastes good? We will continue to buy from San Francisco."}
