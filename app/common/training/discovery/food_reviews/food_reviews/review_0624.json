The flavor is great!<br /><br />As other posts have mentioned, it does not look like a traditional K cup (which is, incidentally, why the price is so great! No \"k-cup\" royalties, right?) but works just like a Kcup.  The coffee is packaged in bags freshness, and the company thoughtfully included a plastic food storage container for storing the open package.  Sure, it's a cheap-o container, but it works and I think it was a really nice touch by the company to ensure that my opened package of coffee stays fresh.<br /><br />The price is HALF of what I've been paying for my K-Cups from the supermarket, so I am VERY very pleased.  My household goes through 8-10 cups a day, so the savings is significant for us.  5 stars!<br /><br />Happy. :-)"}
