I was so dissapointed in the k-cups after the Green Mountain takeover, almost to the point of looking for another brewing method. Then my brother in law suggested I try this coffee. WOW! One of the best cups I have ever had from my Keurig.  Not so thrilled with the Rain Forest blend but the Fog Chaser is the bomb! Don't confuse this with Fog Litter. Don't let the difference in the pod scare you, works great in my brewer. I just ordered a pack of the French Roast. Can't wait to try it."}
