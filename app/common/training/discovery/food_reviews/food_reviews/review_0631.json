This one still isn't quite as strong as I'd make myself, but it's close.  Very enjoyable.  One great thing that I noticed in the packaging (80-count) was that they included a plastic container which fit 1 bag of the cups very easily.  This will serve me well in keeping the unused but open-bag cups fresh."}
