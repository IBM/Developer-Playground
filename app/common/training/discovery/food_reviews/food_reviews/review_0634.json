It works great with K-cup type brewer even though it is not a k-cup.  Since it is not a full plastic cup, I do store the units in a covered canister.  Using a canister instead of the rack is a small price to pay for the difference in price to regular K-cups.  The coffee has wonderful flavor.  I like a bold cup of coffee in the morning.  If I dont have this, I drink Donut Shop.  I like the San Francisco Bay so much, I get two boxes on auto ship every month."}
