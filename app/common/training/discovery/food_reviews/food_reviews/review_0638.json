When I opened the box I was alarmed that the pods were not K cups. Well, I popped the first pod into my Kuerig coffee machine and what came out was the aptly named foggy coffee.  Dark coffee that had a nice bite to it.  I will be ordering more products from this company as their coffee rocks the house. The price was better than the K cups and it is because, I suspect, the pods that they make are a plastic ring with the coffee encased in coffee filter paper.  I dont konow if they created these new pods but the are ingenious and they work perfectly, well done!"}
