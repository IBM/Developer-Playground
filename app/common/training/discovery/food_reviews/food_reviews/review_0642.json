The first thing I did was put some in my dry hair to absorb for a few hours. After shampooing, my hair was MUCH softer than it was before. I've put few drops on my ends 2 more times since then and my hair is soooo soft now! In that time, I've used it as a face and body moisturizer and it does NOT make my dry acne prone face break out. Be careful though, coconut oil is not a thick oil so a little goes a loooong way (which is a great thing!). Smells SO good on my skin, gives it a slight, mild toasted coconut smell.<br />I've cooked eggs, kielbasa and pulled pork with it so far and it makes the tastes of those things richer, which is a pleasant surprise. No overpowering coconut taste, just a slight \"ummph\" to the flavor of things I've cooked so far with it.<br /><br />I even like licking the spoon after I've dipped it in the container to get some oil.<br /><br />Right now, I keep it on my kitchen counter in a cruet (oil drizzler) and it is liquid which is fine by me. Will start solidify below 75 degrees though so don't be alarmed if your clear oil starts to become cloudy every once in awhile.<br /><br />I purchased one 15 oz. jar from my local health food store for $9.99 so 2 for $12.17 is a great deal! Will purchase again :)"}
