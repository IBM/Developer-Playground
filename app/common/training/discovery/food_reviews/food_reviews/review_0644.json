This brand is leaps and bounds superior to all the other coconut oils out there. It has comparatively little greasiness on the skin and absorbs quite fast. I use it as a moisturizer, shaving cream, makeup remover, hair conditioner, scar treatment, to relive itching on bug bites, lube (no latex condoms though please), foot treatment at night, massage oil, and I even use it on my pet hedgehog for his dry skin. It has  great texture and faint coconut smell that is pleasing and not overpowering. I don't regularly eat it or use it to cook with, but I have tasted it and it is nearly flavorless. I recommend this to nearly every person I talk to."}
