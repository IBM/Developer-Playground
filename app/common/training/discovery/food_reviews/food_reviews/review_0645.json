For folks with kinky hair this is a wonderful sealant to lock moisture into your hair. Think it's most useful if placed in hair AFTER a leave-in conditioner or other moisturizer. By itself, doesn't seem to moisturize - just sort of sits on the surface, looking greasy for a while. So after you've moisturized, rub a small amount of Nutiva between your hands and then lightly work it through your hair, with attention to your ends. Give it a few minutes to soak in to avoid the soul glo look: at first it will of course be shiny, but it soaks in very quickly and then your hair just looks lush and healthy (unless you get heavy handed with it - then it will stay looking greasy. Go light...you can always add a little more later). It's also a good sealant to use on your skin after putting on body moisturizer.<br /><br />Great in the kitchen too. Can use in pretty much anything, with excellent results. Recommend using this for anything you're going to heat, and saving the olive oil for cold dishes. There are a million other uses for coconut oil, so it's worth taking some time to look into. Cold pressed, virgin, organic coconut oil is what you want. Like with most oils, this one will change consistency depending on the temperature, but even when it solidifies, it will quickly liquify again if you rub it between your hands or heat it. Price of this product seems to vary, would take a quick look to find the most reasonable deal. The scent is earthy, nutty, and not too strong - not overwhelming like chemical coconut scents. Unless you have a sensitivity to/dislike of coconut, think you will like the scent."}
