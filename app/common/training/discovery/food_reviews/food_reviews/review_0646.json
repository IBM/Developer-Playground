Seriously, it's really good stuff. I like the fact it's organic extra virgin--no extra stuff added. I use this oil about as much as I do olive oil. It has a nice flavor; it's not overwhelmingly coconutish. In fact, you can barely taste the coconut--it just adds a nice, mellow flavor to your food.<br /><br />My favorite thing to use it for is popcorn! I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper a few months ago, along with some Amish Country Popcorn, after a friend told me how great it was. YES! It makes the BEST popcorn (see my review for that for more details!) The oil melts nicely and quickly. It doesn't burn easily, so it's great for making foods that require high, fast heat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!<br /><br />PS- The popcorn is Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Gourmet Popping Corn."}
