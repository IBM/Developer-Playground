In fact, this will be the bar from which I will now judge all other coconut oils. After using it for cooking several times, I decided to try a tablespoon in a chocolate protein powder smoothy. With just the protein power, coconut oil, milk and ice and no other ingredients it ended up tasting like an Almond Joy / Mounds bar. Yummm.<br /><br />The size of the tub is perfect - very easy to scoop from. I like that it comes in a two-pack rather than one large container. When I start on the second jar, I will place another order. I never want to be without this brand of coconut oil!"}
