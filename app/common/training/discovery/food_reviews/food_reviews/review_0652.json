It has many health benefits and it smells and tastes heavenly. Some people may find the coconut aroma and flavor distasteful but not I!! I bought my first jar from a health food store, this is my second order and I hope it will arrive in tact as I see a few other reviewers have had troubles with shipping. I do already have experience with this oil though so I'm sure it will be a liquid when I receive and congeal as it is brought back to an air conditioned home's room temperature. That is normal for coconut oil.<br /><br />I am updating this review to say that it came in perfect condition! There were NO LEAKS, both containers were sealed tightly. No issues whatsoever. I just wish I had ordered the largest size since I love this product so much. I have been counting WW points and hit a plateau from using too few points. I began adding 1/2 T of this to my espresso in the AM with some Almond beverage and SF Hazelnut coffee syrup and started dropping the lbs. again! Don't know for sure this is what did it but I'm very happy to have that yummy creamy flavor and still be losing weight! Knowing also I'm adding good fat to my diet.<br /><br />5/9/2012<br />I'm ready to order again and researched the prices again also.  This size, although it gets used up fast, is the same price as the 2 - 54oz sizes and less than the 29oz size so I went with it again."}
