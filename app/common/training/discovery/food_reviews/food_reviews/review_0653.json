I read a bunch of reviews(on a different forum about the good effects of coconut oil):weight loss,:you can use it for a skin lotion and you will smell wonderful... etc. I decided to try it and it was so good you could eat it raw. It didn't absorb into meat but it did take longer to cook. Veggie \"meats\" it absorbed as quickly as other oils but I did lose 2 lbs the first 2 weeks I used it."}
