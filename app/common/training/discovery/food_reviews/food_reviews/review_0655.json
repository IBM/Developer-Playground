I originally used it because I learned that it was the healthiest fat for frying foods, even better than olive oil.  It can be used in place of any fat or oil need.  I use it, not only in cooking, but on my skin.  I use it on my face instead of face cream and my skin is soft and comfortable.  I also use it on the very dry skin on my feet.  I don't particularly like the taste of it, but I have friends who love it. If you like coconut, you will love this on salads etc."}
