My hair: it is very moisturizing and gives me soft, silky hair like no other product has ever given me before. I've used other oils on my hair before (such as extra virgin olive oil), but coconut oil is the best. It is the only oil that can penetrate the hair shaft.<br /><br />2. My skin: coconut oil moisturizes my skin very well. It is also a very good makeup remover. I use coconut oil on any dry spots on my skin, but I do not use it on my face. While many people have no problems using coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, it can be a problem for someone with acne prone skin.<br /><br />3. Cooking: coconut oil is great for cooking. It adds a really great flavor to a bowl of oatmeal. I sometimes even add some into my coffee. I've made cookies and bars with coconut oil and have had great results."}
