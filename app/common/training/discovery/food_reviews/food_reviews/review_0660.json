If I run out, I start craving it. Popcorn is just not the same without melted coconut oil and sprinkling of coarse sea salt. Cannot be morre specific than to say that my body 'feels' better--joints, mobility, sense of well being since I started consumming it regularly. The scent of it is intoxicating as well. I for one don't need a scientific \"paper\" to tell me what my body needs and responds well to."}
