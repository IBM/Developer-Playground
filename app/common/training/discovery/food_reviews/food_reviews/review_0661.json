Coconut oil isn't just a great, healthy fat, it's also a fat that adds a delicious coconut flavor to anything you cook with it.  I was used to coconut as a sweet thing, but through working with this I've found that it goes wonderfully with a wide range of savory foods too.<br /><br />I've no experience of any other brand of coconut oil, as this was the first one I tried.  However, it's such good quality that I'd not consider trying another one now.  Really excellent, and something to make sure you always have in your cupboard, especially if you're following a Paleo style of diet."}
