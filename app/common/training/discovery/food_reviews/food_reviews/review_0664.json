This is made in the Philippines - one of the top three countries where coconuts are bountiful. Trust me! There are so many health beneficial you can get from coconut oil. Google it or read a book about Lauric Acid, which is the main source of the coconut oil. You will find other great health benefits of this product. As for me, I take 2 tablespoons everyday.<br /><br />The price went up a little bit because the consumer demand is getting huge! But still Amazon has the cheapest price out there. You can compare the price to any herb/organic retail store. Ordering through Amazon will save you more."}
