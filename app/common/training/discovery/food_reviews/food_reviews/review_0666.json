I think this one is the most selling coconut oil in the market right now.  I'd highly recommend this oil, but not Amazon for buying it.  It took them an entire week just to prepare the shipment, and they couldn't give me a good reason why they took so long.  I placed another order through via different website yesterday, and I've already received an e-mail today and indicated that I'll receive this shipment tomorrow!  This oil has a strong aroma, and I like it.  However, my husband hates it, and if you don't like the smell of coconut, I'd recommend Jarrow brand that is brown bottle.  It's also organic, but it's expeller pressed, so I heard it's almost odorless.  I'll also buy Jarrow in the future to use more widely in cooking.  I use Nutiva from head to toe, and I also use it to make scrambled eggs.  You can smell the oil in the food, so if you don't like the coconut smell, that'd be a problem."}
