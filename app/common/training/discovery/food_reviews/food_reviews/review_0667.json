I keep trying this for various things and it's helped with all of them so far.<br /><br />A tiny bit on my face before bed. Now my face is soft.<br />Dry, calloused feet? A tiny bit rubbed on my feet then slept in socks. Now my feet are softer.<br />Ladies with \"chafing issues\" - coconut oil to the rescue.<br />I have not tried it on my hair yet.<br /><br />My other jar is in the kitchen. It's great in coffee and gives scrambled eggs a whole new taste.  I think it would be great on a waffle. That's next."}
