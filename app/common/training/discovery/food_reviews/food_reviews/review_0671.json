I've fried up char-siu fried rice, shrimp fried rice, scrambled eggs, and even made grilled cheese sandwiches using this oil.  Everything comes out tasting great, with just a tiny hint of coconut aftertaste - not enough to overpower the dishes, but just enough for people to go \"what was that extra seasoning you used?  It's really good!\".<br /><br />The bottles pictured are not exactly the bottle you will receive - I got two smaller looking tubs of the coconut oil.  There were no problems with shipping, but I did notice that on a 70 degree day that my bottle of oil went liquid, so I can see problems arising when shipping during summer.  I haven't tried using this product on my skin or hair, but I can imagine it would smell nice - I love coconut!  Highly recommended."}
