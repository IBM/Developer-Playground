I just received the same message that they can't fulfill my order!!???? I have NO complaints about this product, and I expect it to be a bit messy in summer! (it is OIL!!!). Why is this product no longer available from the supplier? I am on auto ship so I can keep a consistent supply since I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Great product but questionable practice by Amazon to say the least."}
