Expect Greasy Delivery in Hot Weather.","text":"The benefits of organic Coconut Oil are endless and this brand is wonderful.  Another reviewer had warned about ordering cocounut oil in hot weather days. Coconut oil is liquid at room temperature, so it'll probably leak & evaporate from jar at 85*F+  (wildly guessing here).<br /><br />If you look at the same item in FL store shelves, their jars are kinda greasy too especially in the spring/summer months.<br /><br />I got my shipment today. Amazon did a superb job in packaging. And yet no matter how well packaged, the jars in bubble wrap, plastic bag & box, leaked the same.<br /><br />Gotta expect the oil to leak from jar while in transit in hot weather and also be prepared to do some smart cleaning upon receipt.  I suggest leaving jars in bubble wrap + bag. Place all on paper towels and put inside fridge for 1/2 hr. When oil is solid, remove wrappings. Rinse jars under warm water, use oil residue on hands, arms, face (never let a good crisis go to waste!)  Inspect lids & seals. All should be intact, maybe just a tad oily. After rinsing & once product is partially solid, there should be NO leaking from anywhere. If so, then the jar must be cracked. Remove oil and place in another container -- a glass jar would be best.<br /><br />The product is great and perhaps worth the hassle if ordering in hot days. Another option, would be to place orders in cooler months. No mess. No stress."}
