I decided to order the Nutiva brand because it was about half the price.  All in all I am pleased with  my purchase.  I slightly prefer the Barleans because I think it is smoother and has a fresher scent, the Nutiva smells more sweet and has a bit of a lingering smell. I have not used the Nutiva brand in cooking yet. But I love organic coconut oil and Nutiva has a great price on amazon."}
