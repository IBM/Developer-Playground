Unlike my other fave, evoo, it is not strong in flavor and you can fry chicken with it or use it for \"buttering\" cheese toast and although the coconut smell is stronger, the taste is sort of mildly bland, barely there at times, if you use it sparingly.<br /><br />What I absolutely love are the monounsaturated fat health benefits you derive every time you use this certified organic cold-pressed coconut oil.<br /><br />I cannot believe how absolutely positively fantastic I feel.  I wish I had thought to baste the organic Plainville farms turkey I got a few months back with this oil, I think it would have been a treat!  There are so many yummy ways you can use this oil to bring out even more flavors from you food.  My husband loved stir-fried KFC chicken breast and some frozen veggies together in lots of the coconut oil.  And I stir-fried roast Asian duck, and crispy Asian pork with this oil and some frozen veggies.<br /><br />It is versatile and although bland-tasting when used sparingly can add delicious and unique carribean or island flavor when you use it more generously.<br /><br />I love this brand and I am hooked, line and sinker on this oil.  I will be considering looking locally for their hemp and other products to compare with Amazon.com prices as well."}
