The flavor is amazing, the purity and texture is perfect! Not too bad on the price either, especially when shipped with FREE 2day shipping via Amazon Mom/Prime.<br /><br />I use coconut oil for many many things, as my 2 year old is allergic to butter/milk etc. I use it as a butter, as an oil, a lotion, etc.<br /><br />A++!"}
