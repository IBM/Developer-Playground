Previously I had been using the 365 Brand which is an in-store brand provided by a health food store.  It was ok, but it had zero scent and was a bit lumpy.  This brand is SO much better, I love the scent of light coconut and the packaging is plastic which is great because its not super heavy like the glass jars I usually encounter (and the fact that I am a bit clumsy and could easily drop and shatter it).  Its super versatile for cooking, I give it to my dog and cats for their overall health and well-being, and I use it as a hair conditioner which is by far my favorite use for it (as a preshampoo or overnight conditioner).  HIGHLY recommended."}
