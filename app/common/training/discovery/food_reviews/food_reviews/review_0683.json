I like that a little goes a long way. There is a slight coconut undertaste that cooks away at higher temps.  I have a Presto Microwave popcorn popper and it works well with that. I also used some on my hair to see if it would stop the breakage I'm having due to medications but no change yet.  It has however made an improvement on my finger cuticles so maybe with time it would help my hair too. I say give it a try, you don't lose anything if you use it in place of another oil you were going to buy."}
