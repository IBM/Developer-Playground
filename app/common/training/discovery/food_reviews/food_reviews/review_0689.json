Previously, my go-to coconut oil was manufactured by Spectrum, and for a time, I was pleased. I then found the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil and have not turned back.<br /><br />The aroma and flavor are real, raw, and extremely pleasurable. Open the jar and take a whiff; I guarantee that you have never smelled a coconut oil like this one."}
