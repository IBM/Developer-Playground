In the winter, you don't need to worry about it spilling in shipment because it is solid below 76 degrees F.  I don't actually like shredded coconut but I love the taste of this coconut oil (guess I don't like the texture of coconut!).  I've only used it once so far, and that was to cook a Mexican-style fajita mix with vegetables (onion, garlic, peppers, tomato, and chile) and black beans.  There was a hint of the coconut flavor in the finished product, but it tasted really good!  I am trying to figure out how to eat more of this oil, but I will definitely use it in place of olive oil for sauteeing vegetables.  It is safe for cooking up to 350 degrees.  It melts quickly.  This is good quality coconut oil for a great price!  I bought it here on Amazon because I wanted to try it and the price was much cheaper than elsewhere online."}
