I really enjoy it's clean fresh taste and light texture. I now only use real butter about 10% of the time for it's butter flavor and extra virgin olive less than 5% of the time in a few Italian dishes.  I no longer use shortening or margarine or other cooking oils for cooking or baking. I keep small amounts in fancy recycled jars in my bathrooms,bedrooms and purse to use instead of hand lotions or massage/body oils.  I love how it softens and protects my skin in Idaho's dry climate."}
