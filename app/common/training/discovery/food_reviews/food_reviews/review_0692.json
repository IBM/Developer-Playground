It wasn't until my massage therapist starting using it for massaging, that I became aware of it's many uses.  I just rec'd. my second order and continue to find more and more uses.<br /><br />I use it primarily for hair and skin.  A small amount rubbed through my hair at night covered with a shower cap, and shampooed out in the morning leaves my hair soft and shiny.  This works much better than chemically laden and costly hair products.<br /><br />In place of commercial lotions, this leaves my dry skin soft and smooth.  The coconut fragrance is light and dissipates quickly, so it doesn't interfere with any other fragrances you may use.<br /><br />It has worked well with what little cooking I do!  LOL  Add a couple of spoonfuls to homemade smoothies.<br /><br />As for cost...Amazon's price is exactly half of my local health food store, for the identical brand.<br /><br />I do agree with many others regarding the packaging.  A glass jar would be preferable.  The plastic is too flimsy for the product."}
