I've made muffins, cake, pancakes using this instead of butter - all turned out excellent and the recipes didn't require any finagling. It does impart a coconutty scent to a dish though I don't think that the flavor itself is noticeable. I especially like using this for stir-fries. It holds up to heat well and gives an extra dimension to the many scents/flavors in asian dishes. It pairs really nicely with lots of chili and lime.<br /><br />I also use the oil as a body moisturizer. It is absolutely wonderful for the skin after a shower. I've even used it on my hair. a little goes a long way but i like to smear it on when still in the shower and dry some of it off. Its also great for the lips throughout the day. My skin is very soft and the smell fades as you dry.<br /><br />I love this package because I can put one tub in the kitchen and one in the bathroom."}
