I learned that coconut oil consists of predominately medium-chain fatty acids which digest more easily, are the kinds of fats in mother's milk, and are preferentially used by the liver as a source of fuel to produce energy.<br /><br />Cooking can significantly affect many fats and oils causing the formation of toxic compounds. However, coconut oil is safe for cooking because it is the oil with the largest amount of saturated fatty acids and the least amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Ninety-two percent is saturated and only 1.5 percent is polyunsaturated. You can use coconut oil for cooking without having to worry about it harming your health. It is so stable you can reheat the oil and use it several times without damaging it. Not only does coconut not form harmful toxins when heated, but it also has many health benefits.<br /><br />For more information on coconut oil benefits, I recommend Dr. Bruce Fife's books on the subject.<br /><br />I love the taste of this oil and use it almost exclusively for cooking.  I put it in our morning oatmeal for a wonderful coconut flavor and the added health benefits that it gives.  I use it in most of my baked goods, as well."}
