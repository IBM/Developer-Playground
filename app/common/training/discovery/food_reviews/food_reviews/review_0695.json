It's one of the best things in the world for you, and I make sure my son gets at least a spoonful of it a day.  Only difficulty I've had with it is that I just moved to a warmer climate, where it is 80 inside instead of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, so instead of having the consistency of butter, it stays liquid unless I put it in the fridge, where it gets hard as a rock. So I leave it out since the liquid is easier to use, but I miss that in-between state where its a soft solid so I can spoon it instead of pour it. Not going to run the A/C all day just for my coconut oil!"}
