It definitely smells like coconut, like a mounds bar. I was so concerned about the popcorn tasting like nothing but coconut. I was VERY surprised buy the wonderful taste it gives the popcorn, I can't believe I never realized at the movies that the reason the popcorn taste so good is that bit of coconut flavor to it. It also left my popcorn machine very clean, when the other oil coated the whole machine in a greasy gunk. Combine with Eden Organics Organic popcorn kernels from Amazon for a total organic popcorn. I received a mini popcorn machine like you would find in a theater for Christmas. After going through the sample packs of yellow gunk oil that came with it for popping I searched for a more healthier and natural way to make popcorn. I read a lot about different oils people use, but one thing was always the same, if you want it to taste like at the movies use coconut oil."}
