I use this as a hair and skin conditioner. It is much easier to apply than extra virgin olive oil, but works just as well for healthy hair growth. As for my skin, I've stopped buying regular lotion because it softens and conditions it on its own.<br /><br />I can't offer a review about cooking with this oil, although coconut oil in general tolerates higher temperatures than other oils due to its primarily solid state. I'll have to buy more and test it out:-)"}
