The taste is very light coconut flavor.  It melts easily and doesn't burn.  I put this on corn and it seemed to make sweet corn sweeter.  I have cooked with it too with excellent results.  I just love the taste and it is much more healthy than butter.  And, it smells so good!  I see this as a staple in my kitchen from now on.  I am so glad that I tried it!"}
