Great for skin and hair care.  Even great for removing sap or any other icky stuff you may get on you from outdoors.  A little goes a long way on skin.  Also great as substitute on anything you'd usually use butter for.  Have used for cooking as well as just spread on toast.  Discount for subscribe and save great too!  Melts/liquid form at 76 degrees or above otherwise will be solid, sort of lard consistency, but melts easily."}
