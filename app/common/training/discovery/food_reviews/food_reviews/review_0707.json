Ignoring the fact that it's in a plastic container, this stuff is awesome. It smells and taste just like when my mother makes coconut oil so I know that it's organic and all natural. All the other oils I've purchased usually have a strong overpowering smell and usually remain liquid even in cold temperatures letting me know they aren't good. I've made my own but it only makes a bit so I thought I'd try Nutiva and I'm glad I did. This stuff has the light nutty smell and solidifies quickly true to coconut oil. I'd definitely recommend this stuff."}
