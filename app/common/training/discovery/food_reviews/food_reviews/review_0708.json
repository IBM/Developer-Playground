Don't mistake healthy for bland tasting either, the coconut flavor actually enhances the dishes I cook. The oil is solid at room temp, it quickly turns to a liquid when heated. I also use this product as a leave in hair conditioner. This is no exaggeration when I say it works better than any commercial hair conditioner product I've tried. It works well as a facial moisturizer too. To use it on your face or hair, just put some of the oil in your palms, it will be solid so to liquefy it rub both palms together in a circular motion, after a few seconds you will have a natural, effective skin and haircare solution in the palm of your hands."}
