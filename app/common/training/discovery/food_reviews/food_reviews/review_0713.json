What I didn't like was the new upgraded opaque white jar that Nutiva now uses for the coconut oil. I have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar. I think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars. There is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold.  At the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line. In summer temperatures I have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where I leave the jar. This was not a problem with the previous jars. Nutiva should address this problem right away."}
