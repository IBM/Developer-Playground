While I hope that changes soon, I need to get my \"fix\".  Nutiva has a clean, lightly coconut scented product with good prices for the size. It's organic and cold pressed so heat hasn't rendered away any antioxidants and benefits. I use it like butter on bagels, and for my cooking oil. I use olive oil for salads because coconut oil is a solid under about 70 to 75. I also use it for oil pulling for dental health. I mildly dislike the plastic container but I've read that the grade is good and won't leach chemicals into the contents."}
