Well, ran out of Louana brand and found that I had a bit of this left from my last order.  When I opened it up the smell of coconut was a pleasant surprise.  I opened the louana tub again, no smell.  I love making popcorn with this oil and one of the things I liked was the coconut scent and flavor, mild though it is.  So I'm back on a monthly subscription service with the Nutiva again :)  It's a good value compared to others that I have looked at also."}
