Kate","HelpfulnessNumerator":1,"HelpfulnessDenominator":1,"Score":5,"date":"2012-07-22","Summary":"Nutiva vs. Barlean's","text":"Both are organic and cold-pressed. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0\">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a> discernibly smells more of coconut. The consensus seems to be that it has a smoother texture and stronger coconut flavor. So if you're eating it by the spoonful or spreading it on toast or want a shot in your smoothie, that would be the way to go, if you don't mind paying a little more.<br /><br />I'm mostly using coconut oil for cooking, so I like the more subtle fragrance of Nutiva. I can use it for most anything that calls for canola oil without everything tasting of coconut--mostly it just adds a certain savory quality, like umami, and makes your kitchen smell amazing.<br /><br />It's also great as a deep-conditioning treatment for hair. I leave it in for a few hours and my hair feels soft and unprocessed after washing it out with my regular shampoo. I love it because it changes the texture of my hair without weighing it down."}
