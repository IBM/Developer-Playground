I READ A FEW REVIEWS ABOUT HOW THIS \"NUTIVA ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN COCONUT OIL\" SO DECIDED TO GO FOR IT. I PURCHASED THE TWO PACK SO I USED ONE FOR MY COOKING AND THE OTHER ONE I USED IT FOR MY PERSONAL CARE.I USE THE ONE IN MY KITCHEN FOR MY SMOOTHIES, MILK SHAKES, BAKING, AND DO FRY MY EGGS AND A FEW OTHER FOODS THAT WONT USE THAT MUCH OF OIL SINCE THIS OIL IS EXPENSIVE. I USE THE ONE IN MY BATHROOM FOR MY HAIR AS AN ANTI-FRIZZ AND IT DOES WORK FOR MY LONG LATINA THICK FRIZZY HAIR. I USE IT AS A SKIN MOISTURIZER AND IT LEAVES MY SKIN SOFT, BUT A LITTLE GREASY ON MY FOREHEAD AND SHIN, BUT NOT BAD BECAUSE I ONLY USE IT BEFORE BED. OH YEAH AND IT DOES MAKES YOUR STRETCH MARKS SOFTER TOO."}
