I do love chocolate and had a free sample of this and was hooked. Since these sell in NY for about $3 a bottle I decided to buy the cases. As soon as I saw that amazon only had a few left I bought 4 boxes. Hopefully they get more in stock when I am ready.<br /><br />Side note: I used to get really bad headaches at work and now that I drink one with my lunch I feel much better (refreshed). I highly recommend giving it a try."}
