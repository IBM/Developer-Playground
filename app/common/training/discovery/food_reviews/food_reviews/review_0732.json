In the past i had only used gatoraid and that was not stopping the cramps.I had tried Zico in other flavors but chocolate is the only one I can tolerate. I actually love the chocolate. Since using it after runs over 90mins. I no longer get cramps. It is best cold. I also mix it into my smoothie as a recovery drink. I order it by the case now since my grocery store does not always have it and I don't want to run out."}
