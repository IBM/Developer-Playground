Of course, you gotta look up first to inspect if there are coconuts above. It might be dangerous when ripe. Oh! but locals climb palm trees to harvest the fruit.  With a machete they open up the top and voila, a super refreshing 40 to 50 calories drink.<br /><br />Zico water reminds me of the flavor tasted. I purchase it in Safeway and/or Trader Joe's ( I live in California now). Relatively cheap and likely the real thing without so much processing.<br /><br />I recommend it. Trust me. It is good. ;0)"}
