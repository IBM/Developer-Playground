I am not surprised that this product is always on back order at Amazon. After all, it is so fresh, tastes purely natural, and is extremely refreshing, that anyone who tries it once will love it. We have been using it since last 4 months and have been so used to it that I had to use the \"Subscribe n Save\" option which beats the price of this product from everywhere else.<br />It comes well packaged and the containers are very easy to store, carry, and drink directly from the bottle. Love this product and highly recommend it!"}
