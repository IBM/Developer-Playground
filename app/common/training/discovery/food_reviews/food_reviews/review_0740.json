Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts.  It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories.  I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.<br /><br />This chocolate flavor is excellent imho.  It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.<br /><br />Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.<br /><br />Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.<br /><br />About me:  I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give \"5\"-star reviews."}
