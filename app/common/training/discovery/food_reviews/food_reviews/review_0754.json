I found that cooling the contents a bit tasted much better than consuming them at room temperature or chilling them.<br /><br />Also, the contents contain more sodium than water but, then again, you derive maximum benefit from coconut water if you use it as protection against dehydration or for replenishment, and not as a substitute for regular water. Also, drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade seemed to make me feel more bloated - so far, I have experienced nothing of that sort with Zico. Admittedly, carrying a Powerade bottle to the gym looks much more normal than carrying a Zico coconut water bottle :-)<br /><br />For what it's worth, my mom-in-law suffers from hyperacidity and has found the Natural variant of ZICO to be a blessing.<br /><br />I didn't give this 5 stars because I haven't been consuming it for long to know what side effects there might be, and nothing beats real coconut water, right out of a tropical coconut."}
