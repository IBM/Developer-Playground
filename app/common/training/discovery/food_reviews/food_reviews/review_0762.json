I decided to purchase from Amazon since they deliver and those bottles are heavy to shelp up my stairs. I would give this 5 stars but 3 out of my 6 bottles had cap defects. The caps were starting to separate from the bottle which resulted in leakage and possible contamination.<br /><br />I've seen this in grocery stores as well, so I know it's not an \"Amazon\" issue. :(<br /><br />I notified Zico online- I guess we will see what happens.<br /><br />On a unrelated note.. Amazon you should have a spell check option within the review section..."}
