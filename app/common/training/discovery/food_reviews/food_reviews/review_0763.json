The first two times, the dozen I received were fine. This time, there was something wrong with the batch; I'm not sure if Amazon used a different distributor or something else happened. The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a \"slightly imperfect\" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico. It's such trouble to call and get a label and send it back and get a refund, especially if, as I did, you break down the boxes and store all the drinks away in the cabinet before you realize they're no good! Just a word of caution."}
