When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.<br /><br />I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8SO10\">Naked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. It's as good as the old Zico was if not better."}
