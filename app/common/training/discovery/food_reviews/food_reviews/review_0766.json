Every week, I would drive over to my local Whole Foods, pick up a few boxes of any brands I could find comparable flavors for and I always made sure to buy two or three at once to compare flavors.  Nothing ever really stuck taste-wise until I found this and it's absolutely delicious.  If you remember drinking Yoohoo as a kid, you'll recognize this taste immediately.  I don't know how Zico did it but this tastes identical to that chocolately smooth goodness of my youth but, you know, much healthier.  I will say though, it tastes much better cold -- as the bottle says -- but that doesn't mean it's bad when it's warm, it's just better cold, that's all.<br /><br />I also carry these to the gym and when I run obstacle course races, especially if I'm unsure of what the post-race rehydration drink will be (typically Powerade or Gatorade).  I honestly didn't think much to Zico's claims on their site and the bottle that it supports \"rapid hydration\", whatever that is, but I do know that its huge amounts of potassium have kept me from bonking after a race to maintaining my perk.  I typically pound one of these and one to two bananas or Larabars post-race and I've certainly jump started the recovery process better than I ever did with sports drinks or water alone.  After I'm done in the gym, I chug some Zico to cool off and wash the taste of electrolyte-flavored water out of my mouth.  I can definitely tell a difference in my moods after racing or lifting when I drink some coconut water versus when I'm just drinking water alone.<br /><br />For me, no brand can touch Zico in the taste department on this one."}
