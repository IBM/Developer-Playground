I like it ice cold.  It was very benificial in bringing my 90 year old mother back from dehydration.  Shared it with a couple of my friends who have had some health issues.  Not saying it is a cure--no, but it has certainly helped with not having enough intake of fluids.  It rates a 5 star from me.  Thanks ZICO & Amazon for making my purchase affortable & easy to purchase."}
