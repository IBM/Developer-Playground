The latest is Zico  Mango. It's all right. It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"}
