I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.  One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more).  The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add."}
