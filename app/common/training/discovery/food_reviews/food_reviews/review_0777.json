It's 100% natural and soooo delicious. It's super powered water, that's good for you AND tastes like dessert! For a really healthy snack or smoothie, make ice cubes of the Zico chocolate water and blend with frozen bananas. For a little more of an energy burst, add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter. SO GOOD! :)"}
