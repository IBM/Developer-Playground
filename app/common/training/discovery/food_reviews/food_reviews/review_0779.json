The taste is unique but great. I did a marathon in January and the chocolate Zico was my best friend during my training. Not only was it refreshing after my long runs, but I instantly felt rehydrated. I have told anyone that I meet to try it after long runs and they always come back and tell me how I was right. I have probably gotten at least 5 other runner's to be Zico drinkers :)"}
