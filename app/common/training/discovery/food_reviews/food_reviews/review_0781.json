Once we put them on Beneful, they have had healthier digestion and healthier skin and coat.  They really love the chunks and they are medium sized dogs but for small breeds you'd want to get smaller kibble size.  I love that it is in a big resealable bag so I can just scoop out what I need and then close it back up.  Both of our dogs have eaten Beneful for a couple of years and always get good reports at their vet checkups.  It costs a little more than store brand dog food but you really are getting a much higher quality product.  My pups love it so much that they've learned to carry their bowl around in their teeth until I get the point and refill the bowl so they must like it.  I will continue to buy it and recommend.  It's great dog food."}
