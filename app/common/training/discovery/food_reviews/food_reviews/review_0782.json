We've tried some other beef dog foods in the past and the end result (no pun intended) is usually a smelly gassy dog that has to go frequently.  So I wasn't sure if we'd be in for more of the same when I decided to have him give this food a try.  He's been eating it for a little over a week now and I'm very surprised that he's had no issues with it.  He's been gobbling it up so I'd say that's a pretty good indicator that he likes it.<br /><br />I do think the food bits are a bit large for him.  He's a small dog (Pug/Jack mix) and I've noticed that it seems like he has to work a little harder to chew this food compared to his regular food."}
