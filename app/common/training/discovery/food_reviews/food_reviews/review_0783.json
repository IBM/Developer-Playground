Beneful is what we went with. I can find it easily at Amazon and Wal-Mart and other retailers. My dog - a three-year-old mix, part lab and part basset hound - eats it up, and it's reasonably priced.<br /><br />The size of this bag is nice, as is the plastic-y packaging with the zipper top which is easy to open and close. We're pleased with it!"}
