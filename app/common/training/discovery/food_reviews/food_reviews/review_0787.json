I didn't want to buy something that would harm my dogs and I figured that if it had a top name it couldn't be too bad.<br /><br />As I became older and understood more about nutrition for myself and my family I started to apply that knowledge to my choice of food for my dogs.  I continued to stick with the name brands, I just bought their more expensive lines.  One of the foods that I tried was Purina's Beneful.<br /><br />My dogs have always liked it okay, but as I tried more organic and natural lines I found that the dogs not only liked it but it seemed to improve their health.  Their coat was shinier and their pooh seemed, well... better, nicer, less stinky.  Still, Beneful is nice as a backup or just for something different every now and then.  However, I would rather spend more for a dog food that has what I perceive to have better quality ingredients."}
