He loved this. In fact, he gobbled down the entire bowl, and that was after he had already had his breakfast bowl for the day.<br /><br />I can't think of anything not to love about this dog food. It must have a terrific taste because our dog liked it, and he's a somewhat picky eater.<br /><br />The nutrition is balanced, and I believe that the combination of ingredients will keep your dog healthy. It has the right balance of protein and grain. It's a softer dog food, so you may want to consider mixing it with a crunchier dog food.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent choice for your dog."}
