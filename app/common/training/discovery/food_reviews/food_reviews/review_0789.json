It is dog food appropriate for all ages.  Only the size and age of your dog will determine how much you need to put in the bowl.  Bag itself is very economical.  It is bagged with quick zip that helps keep food fresh.  No need to empty your 15.5 lb bag into container in order to keep the food fresh.  In addition to beef, this dog food mix contains eggs, minerals,(calcium and iron), vitamins A and E and selenium that will help your puppy'sd immune system.  What really suprises me about this food is that is has lots of vegetables: spinach, corn and peas in addition to grains - oats.<br /><br />My friend's dog is currently on a bean diet (recommended by veterinarian, so he can loose weight.  Dog was deligthed with this food.  His proportions are measured carefully and it seems that veggies and oats give him sense of fullness.  He definitely does not overeat and he seems to be very happy with his menu right now.  I must say it is delight to watch that little animal eat and be so happy afterwards.<br /><br />This is balanced nutrition.  The entire package amounts for 25% of protein, 10% of fat, 4% of fiber and 14% of moisture.  It is balanced diet food for your pet.  Give it a try!"}
