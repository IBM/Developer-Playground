There are also a number of negative side effects reported. You can find this information if you have google-fu. That said, I am not a nutritionist or a scientist or a veterinarian, and I won't pretend to be & won't comment on those aspects. However, I can comment on how the dogs reacted to this food.<br /><br />They LOVED it! There were no food allergies or reactions as others have reported. The food bits were about the same size as other food products on the market, so this formula might not be ideal for smaller dogs."}
