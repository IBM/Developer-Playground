It doesn't have a particular odor.  It is softer than the food I am used to.  My mixed terrier has been slow to take to this.  This may say more about my dog than the Beneful...  He loves treats and I was sure he would see this as a treat with all the shapes and colors (ok...dogs are color blind but)<br /><br />I think dogs are slow to change what they are used to so I wouldn't take this as meaning your dog won't like Beneful.  Nutritionally, it looks like it is good but I can't tell how much of that is marketing.<br /><br />I'll revise if our dog seems to acclimate more to this."}
