Adult dogs, puppies, weaning puppies, this food will work equally well. In fact, the bag even contains directions on \"feeding for reproduction.\" With that in mind, you're not going to get some ultra-fancy kibble designed for one specific function, but this seems like a good-quality food nonetheless.<br /><br />The bag describes a \"variety of crunchy and moist pieces.\" There are six different pieces, presumably with different flavors. It's a very colorful food, but I don't think the moistness/crunchiness varies much. Rather, it seems to have a consistency comparable to most other dry dog food.<br /><br />It's a nice food, and I should add that I do like the convenient zip-top they put on the bag. My dog seems to enjoy it quite a bit, and I suppose that's what really counts"}
