I was hoping that she would take to the Beneful and mixed a little in with her canned food, and also used some pieces later as a treat. While she did eat some of the Beneful, for the most part she pushed it aside with her nose, and showed little interest later in the kibble as a treat. On the other hand, one of my cats ate what the dog left and was looking for more! I suspect that the fact that my dog has never shown much interest in dry food in general accounts for her lack of interest in Beneful, and is not a reflection on the quality of the product. I like the fact that the bag in which it is packaged has a sliding plastic closure, which I think will keep the contents fresher longer than a pull-apart closure. Perhaps dogs who eat dry food on a regular basis will be more interested in the product."}
