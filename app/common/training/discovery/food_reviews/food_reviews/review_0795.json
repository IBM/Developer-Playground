It's a brand that we buy whenever it happens to be on sale and our dogs don't mind it.<br /><br />Let's face reality, shall we? The LAST thing a dog would eat is 'dog food'. Dogs' favorite food is 'human food', then whatever they can catch if they happen to be outdoor dogs: bird, field mouse, rabbit (raw), the occasional raccoon. Our huskies are outdoor dogs. They do accept dog food whenever none of the above is available and they seem to be as tolerant of the Beneful as they are of most other brands. I am unaware of any dog food recipe, and we've fed them a couple dozen different ones, that they are looking forward to eating rather than eat them because they're hungry.<br /><br />There is a long list of ingredients that make up the Beneful mix and it's not unlike most other dry dog foods. It contains all kinds of veggies - huskies are quite wolf-like and I suspect veggies are a no-no for their wolf cousins - but they don't mind. I wish I could say that, thanks to the magic Beneful recipe our dogs are happy, strong and healthy. They are so but they are probably so because they live outdoors which is where wolf-like dogs love to live and possibly because their diet is varied. They eat Beneful every now and then and they're alright with it but I don't remember one instance where they asked for Beneful by name."}
