Our dog Miley would get excited if I opened a bag of cement and poured it into her bowl! It's when she becomes excited again after eating Benefiful that I knew this was a good product. I mean, sure it's great for her health, and sure it's made with great nutritional items, but will she eat it? You betcha. As she happily eats this, I am kind of jealous, where's the Beneful people food!!!???<br /><br />I only lowered it a star because of the price, which I found a little steep under this economy. But, if you want quality, there is a price you'll have to pay. Your dog will thank you, with pleneful beneful face kisses."}
