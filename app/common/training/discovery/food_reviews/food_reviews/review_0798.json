The largest of our 3 dogs (7 years old and about 70lbs) has an ultra sensitive stomach. When we first got him as a young dog, we tried giving him different vet recommended dog foods, but after months of non-stop gas and runny doggy doo, it was the original Beneful formula that we found he seemed to do best with. Our smallest/oldest/mix-breed dog (11 years old and about 25lbs) does well on any dog food he's given, and so has never had any troubles eating Beneful either. Our youngest dog (about 50lbs and 3 years old) does get some minor gas from time to time with every dog food we have ever given to her, including Beneful. While the other two dogs are both slim and muscular, she's quite pudgy (for a lab) even with all the exercise she constantly gets. At one point we decided to move her to the Beneful Healthy Weight version of this dog food to see if it would help her lose a few pounds. We kept her on it for about 2 months, and while she did lose a little weight, she had non-stop terrible has and upset stomachs. So much so that she went from a very happy cheerful dog to one that seemed miserable and uncomfortable all the time. Within a few days of switching her back to this Beneful Original formula, she was her happy, playful, active self again. It's not the best quality, most expensive dog food on the market, but it's affordable, my dogs enjoy the taste and it doesn't make them sick or uncomfortable like some other brands/versions do."}
