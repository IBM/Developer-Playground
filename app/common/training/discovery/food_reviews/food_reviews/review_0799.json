Normally I feed them Imes but when I gave them a bowl of Beneful they jumped on it. They are small (shitzus) but they had no problems scarrfing this down.It looks pretty good as dogfood goes. It is different shapes and colors and contains chicken by products and beef.All in all it looks fine to me. My dogs eat a mix of canned,dry, fresh vegetables and real meat.I 'm not too worried about their nutrition.I'd say  give it a try."}
