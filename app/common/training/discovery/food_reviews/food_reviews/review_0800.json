The dog likes it and the the dog is healthy, so I figure the food must be okay.  The only problem I have with this brand of food is the \"Healty Weight\" formula.  When our dog was a bit over-weight, I bought that and the dog just went wacky until I gave it more to eat.  It seemed like the Healthy Weight formula was just puffed up regular stuff.  So I just cut back on the regular stuff instead and the dog was fine.  So other than the Healthy Weight formula of this brand of dog food, I have no problem with it."}
