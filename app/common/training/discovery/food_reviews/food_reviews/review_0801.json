For this, I increase this review from an average of three stars to a four.  The dog isn't crazy about this food, but rather than waste such a large bag, we're sneaking small amounts into the food she regularly eats.  For dog owners who aren't familiar with the recommendations of most vets, don't change the food you give a dog suddenly, but mix it with the food they usually eat until it's well-tolerated.  We've not made it to full exchange with this one, but a previous dog of ours years ago liked this food when it was first introduced.  I'd recommend purchasing the food in a smaller amount to be sure your dog likes/tolerates this one."}
