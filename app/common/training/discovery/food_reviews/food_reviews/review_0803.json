For Dogs you want a high protein, low fat diet.  Now granted there are always tales of the dog that lived off of supermarket brand food that lived to be 20, but more often than not I find that the people who spend a little more to get a higher quality food spend much less in the veterinary office.<br /><br />When the bag arrived my dog was thrilled to death because he knew it was obviously for him.  With the primary ingredient being a corn meal I was not a happy mommy.  I also looked and a true meat product was not to be found in the first 3 ingredients on the bag (a sure sign of junk food).  I let him eat the kibble any way, which is full of various shapes and colors (please, dogs don't care about the color of their food - don't put fake coloring in my doggie's dinner).  It also had a strong odor to it that I didn't care for.  The odor enticed my doggie right in but after a few days he seemed completely disinterested in the food.<br /><br />Although I don't like the food, and after the novelty wore off neither did my dog - I did like the bag which contained a FUNCTIONAL zip to close in order to keep the food fresh. Congrats on the great bag, now please work on a better healthier formula for the kibble contained within."}
