However after reading a few of the reviews on this product I felt compelled to pick up the bag and read the ingredients.  I'm not too impressed----animal digest, what is that?, sugar---hmmm, food color, loads of corn meal etc. and then the preservatives which I do understand.  I'm sure it has become a science of manufacturing to create a product that most dogs will like at the cheapest cost to make.  Our dogs have always done well at their annual physicals, so I know there is adequate nourishment in the product, however, I now think there are better and more healthful products available, probably at a premium price, ingredients that would include a higher percentage of meat and poultry and less corn and grain.<br /><br />Do the dogs like this?  Yes<br />Could Nestle improve the ingredients?  Yes<br />Would I purchase again?  Not Sure<br />Is this a bad product?  I don't think so, could just be better.<br />Is there a better product at this price point?  I would really like to know!<br /><br />Just a thought:  Kids like candy, doesn't mean it's good for them!"}
