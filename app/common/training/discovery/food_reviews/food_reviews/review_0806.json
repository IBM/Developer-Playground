In the ingredients description they list it as Crunchy corn packed with carbohydrates for energy... Seriously? My dogs did eat it but I can't say wether or not they liked it but they did have horrid gasseous episodes for days. It comes down to this being the same old stuff in different packaging. Maybe if they put as much thought and effort into the quality of the food as they do in the packaging I would buy it again."}
