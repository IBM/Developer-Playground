The littlest one will even eat celery, so you can't take their taste as a guide.  (Plus, his stomach is too tiny for big dog food, and I saw it again, in the wrong direction.)<br /><br />I rather wonder about all the color--that's for me, not for my dogs.  Ditto the shapes.  Supposed to make me think each little bit of not-crunchy kibble is nutritionally different?  Zip lock packaging maintains freshness, I suppose, and is, in this dog family, a PITA to use.<br /><br />My life takes me to the feed store often enough that delivery doesn't offer any real benefits.<br /><br />My picky eater will go back to getting a spoon of canned food on the kibble when we don't have table scrap to enhance her dogfood, and the chow hounds won't miss the fancy colors and shapes one bit."}
