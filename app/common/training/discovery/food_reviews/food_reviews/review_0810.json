Three of them are rescue dogs and for some time now I have been feeding them what the Rescue was feeding them, Taste of the Wild by Diamond.  I was paying over $45 for a large bag of dog food that recently had the largest recall by Diamond.  My dogs are my babies and I have never had a scare like this before.  I never knew Diamond brands was known for recalling their pet foods.  After researching the internet for brands of pet foods that have never had a recall, I was shocked and impressed to see that Purina DOG food was the only one that never has.  They have had recalls on cat foods but never on dog food.  At least from the articles I found online. If you don't believe Google \"brands of dog food that has never had a recall\", Purina will be listed first.<br /><br />What I found interesting is that to me all dog foods smell \"disgusting\".  It might look appetizing with the different shapes and sizes and pretty colors but I always wondered how they can eat the stuff.  When I fed my pooches the Taste of The Wild, they always left food behind in their dishes.  Since feeding the Purina Beneful all four dishes are left empty.  I know Purina is considered the more \"middle\" brand of animal food, but it has been around for years and most important my dogs love it.  I will continue to feed them the Purina Beneful and give them daily vitamins and healthy treats to make sure they meet their daily recommended nutrition.  There are several varieties to pick from and plan on mixing things up for a little excitement!"}
