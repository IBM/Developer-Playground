I occasionally switch out food brands for my dog to keep things interesting. I have never had a problem in doing this until now. My dog threw up four days in a row! Once we removed the food and switched back, he was fine and the vomiting stopped. I liked the idea of crunchy and soft pieces, and my dog seemed to approve of the taste of the food, but alas, I will not be buying this product in the future."}
