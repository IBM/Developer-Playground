They were not exactly crazy about it, but did eat it if their regular brand was not available after they realized this was all or nothing. They didn't just jump on me to get some or try to tear into the bag though. But they ate it, and then the explosion came. I swear they pooped out a pile for almost every morsel they ate. And GAS! The smell was almost unbearable for us humans."}
