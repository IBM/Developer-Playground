That makes it tough to review dog food.  I'm not a nutrition expert...all I can do is comment on my personal experience.<br /><br />First of all, Beneful dog food smells better than MANY popular dog foods.  That is a BIG plus in my book.  If smell is a decent indicator of how appetizing something might be to eat, then I would say Beneful must taste pretty good to the dog.  Any the dog loves it (as much as any dog who occasionally gets human food scraps can \"love\" dog food).  He always sniffs it with interest when presented, and eats it with gusto when he's ready to eat.  When he decides its time to dig in, he'll polish off his bowl.  That's a pretty good indicator to me.  I think Beneful is a good compromise between your standard \"Dog Chow\" and the much more expensive items you see in speciality pet stores.  It is just a little more expensive than the \"common\" stuff, but if you can't afford the price of the top tier food...I think Beneful makes a great alternative for something a bit more flavorful and which (based on information provided, not any \"scientific research\" on my part) has a bit more concern for providing your pooch with a well balanced diet.<br /><br />I think if you've not tried it, it is WELL worth seeing what your dog things."}
