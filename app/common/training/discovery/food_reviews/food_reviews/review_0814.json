The 1/2\" red one is soft and looks like a piece of beef, the 3/4\" x 1/2\" orange one is hard and looks like a Mickey Mouse head, the 1/2\" green one looks like a pea and is soft, and there is a 1/4\" x 1/3\" tan one that is hard.  My dogs don't care.  Mom is giving them candy and that's all that matters to them.<br /><br />My vet says this is like giving kids sugary cereal.  Of course, the dogs love it, but is it good for them?  It's good for treats and training because it tastes so good."}
