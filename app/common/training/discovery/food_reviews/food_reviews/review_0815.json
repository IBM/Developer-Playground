My 125 pound mastiff has not eaten since last night. He should be hungry. I put a bowl of this food down in front of him and he sniffed it, took one little morsel, played around with it and spit it out. I gave the dog a few minutes and he did get up and eat the one cupful of food that was in the bowl. He does like Purina's wet food, that we give as a topping sometimes on another brand of dog food. I have uploaded a short video of his honest reaction to the first serving of this food. This is a rescue dog and when we got him about nine months ago he weighed 47 pounds, because he had eaten a 9\" long ratchet wrench, with the handle and the head. This dog eats lots of stuff, the couch, my shoes, the remote, but he is not crazy about Beneful.<br /><br />The bag shows big chunks of beef, whole carrots, peas, whole grain wheat. Read the ingredient list before deciding to buy. The veggies are listed at position 20, 21, and 22, after a long list of corn products and other assorted junk food. The colors are really artificially bright, some of the pieces are hard, some soft, they are a nice size for smaller dogs. At my dog's weight, I would have to feed him six and a half cups, according to the chart on the bag. I really don't think he would eat it all. I did get this bag as a Vine promotion, with the hopes that it would be really good, but I think I will have to stick with our old brand."}
