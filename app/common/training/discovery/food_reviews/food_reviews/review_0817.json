Any dry food she doesn't turn her nose up at is a plus.<br /><br />The bag shows chunks of real beef and veggies as well as a picture of the actual food. I don't think a reasonable person would expect to pour out actual beef chunks any more then they would expect to pour a fully frosted cake , like the one on the front of the box, from a box of cake mix. The product page and the back of the bag give the ingredients.  I sort of question the addition of sugar and I suppose the color is for the benefit of the owner but ,from what I've read, the chicken byproducts ( feet, neck etc) are good for the dog. No animal \"waste\" can be used. The word \"meal\" means the byproduct is received in a dry state instead of a wet state.<br /><br />I think the bottom line is do you trust the reputation and integrity of the manufacturer? It's probably not gourmet food but do you trust them to put out a healthy product? Do you believe they get their ingredients from a reputable company and run all the required salmonella and bacterial tests? Since I'm no expert on dog food that's what I have to do."}
