When I mixed this 30% to 70% of his regular dog food, he made a mess getting at the new stuff vs. the old.  I have a small dog (12 pounds) and these are just the right size for him to chew.<br /><br />I also did a \"taste test\" for him by putting some of this in a bowl right next to his regular dog food - he went straight to the Purina after giving each a sniff.<br /><br />What else can I say?  I can't comment on the flavor, texture, and other qualities of the food as I certainly didn't taste it!  However, based upon the dog's reaction I would say it's a winner."}
