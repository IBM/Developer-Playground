Enough said!","text":"If you read the blurb regarding this product you will find that your pet will be ingesting \"wholesale\" ingredients.  Over a year ago we used to feed our dog Beneful; after reading the label upon arrival I was reminded again why we stopped feeding him this overpriced garbage.<br /><br />Our cats are fed Science Diet Sensitive Stomach and our dog was/is eating a previously reviewed Vine product, Iams Sensitive Naturals Ocean Fish.  He is about to finish up that 25 pound bag.  After the bag finishes, I will have to walk into a pet store and methodically read the ingredients list before choosing another brand.  I would remain with the Iams Natural but I am concerned by the dry stools.  Then again, that is better than runny stools.<br /><br />Purina Beneful Original Dog Food's main ingredients are:<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Chicken By-Product meal<br />Corn Gluten Meal<br />Whole Wheat Flour<br />Preserved Animal Fat<br /><br />This is not good nor healthy!  This product is loaded with corn, corn and chicken by-product (read: eyeballs and beaks!).<br /><br />Did Furbie(Cock-a-poo)love it?  YES, but he also struggled with the kibble size and would always leave the uglier colored hard bits.  We would replenish the bowl and throw away the graveyard of green & yellow bits that remained.<br /><br />DO not recommend!  There are healthier alternatives priced right.  This is over-priced and comparable to the bottom of the barrel off-name brands."}
