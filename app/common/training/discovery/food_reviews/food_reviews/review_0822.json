{"Id":"240058","ProductId":"B001VJ0B0I","UserId":"A1HOLE9R6WPT85","ProfileName":"Mad Max","HelpfulnessNumerator":3,"HelpfulnessDenominator":4,"Score":2,"date":"2012-05-22","Summary":"Dog loves it, price is a bit high, question the quality of ingredients","text":"I love the idea of Amazon delivering things like this direct to my door. And my dog Cody loves it, but then again, he'll eat about anything (he's outside this very moment trying to catch & eat Cicadas, so he's not exactly a connoisseur!)<br /><br />However, I have some problems with this product. First, the price is a bit high (currently $21 on Amazon, but only $15 at Target or Walmart).<br /><br />Second, I really question the quality of ingredients. In the first 10 or 15 ingredients, there are only *two* real foods - wheat is #5 and beef is #7. And I'm not even certain that wheat is an essential ingredient. Otherwise it's all filler. Corn is not good for dogs (not digestible for any mammals, actually). Sugar is not good for dogs. Chicken \"by-product\" means ground-up bones, fat, tendons, things like that. And, there are a lot of petroleum-based dyes, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />Most importantly, for about the same price ($1.35 per pound), you can buy the good stuff. For example, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6\">Prairie Natural Dry Dog Food</a> is only $1.48 per pound.<br /><br />My recommendation (regardless whether you feed your pet the cheap stuff or not) is to supplement your pet's diet with scraps from your kitchen. We never ever feed our dog from the table or while we're cooking, but instead we'll peel the fat off chicken or keep little chunks of veggies & keep it in the fridge for his next meal. This will save you money and ensure your dog gets some fresh foods in his/her diet, some essential enzymes, etc."}
