On one hand, my dogs love it. The bowl doesn't stay full for very long. They've been so picky with dog food that it was a relief to find something they would willingly eat. However, my Corgi liked to just pick out the soft pieces and leave the hard food for my Chihuahua. Because she only ate the soft pieces and gorged until the bowl was empty, my Corgi became overweight and her dental health suffered. We had to switch to a different brand to keep her healthy.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who feels the packaging is false advertising. There is no meat or vegetables in Beneful. It says right on here that the first two ingredients are ground cornmeal and chicken by-product. Yuck! That really grossed me out. I don't want my dogs eating this anymore and switched them to a more wholesome brand."}
