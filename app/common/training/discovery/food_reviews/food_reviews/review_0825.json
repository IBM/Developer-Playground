The main ingredient in this dog food is<br />corn meal. (There are also wheat and rice flour in this<br />product.) It also contains sugar (!) and 4 different<br />artificial colors (!!!!). Who is the color for? Do dogs<br />care about color? No! Shame on you, Purina - this is not a<br />\"natural food\" for a dog."}
