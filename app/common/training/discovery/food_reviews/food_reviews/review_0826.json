I have spent, literally, hundreds of dollars on organic, grain-free, all-natural, blah, blah, blah dry dog food for her and I have ended up giving it to my co-workers (for their dogs, although the thought has crossed my mind. Think THE HELP.) For a while she was all gung ho on Chef Michael's dog food but she stopped eating it after a few weeks. Then came Beneful.<br /><br />From the minute she tried it she has been happy as a little clam. Other reviewers have claimed that this brand of dog food is full of fillers and bad things but at this point I don't really give a hoot. If my almost 13-year-old litle princess will eat it willingly and enthusiastically then it could be supplemented with spider eggs and I wouldn't care. I am so sick and tired of trying to hand feed her, piece by piece, that if she is willing to eat Beneful without my cajoling then we have a winner.<br /><br />At night when she sleeps with me I have noticed that she has a bit more gas now and that gas is stinkier than it has been in the past, but I guess turnabout is fair play. Overall, I couldn't be happier with Beneful, and as long as Lily will eat it then I will continue to buy it."}
