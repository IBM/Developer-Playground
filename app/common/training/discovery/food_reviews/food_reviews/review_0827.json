When it was being delivered to our house, our neighbor's (extremely well-behaved) little dog tore across the street to try to get the food from the post-man.  (The poor man is terrified of dogs.)  Our own dogs tried chewing through the box it came in and then, when the box was opened and the bag removed (and placed safely atop the fridge) decided to take up residence in the box.<br /><br />And the sturdiness of the bag and its \"ziplock type\" top probably pretty much guarantee that the food will stay smelling great.  Unfortunately, the ingredients do not live up to the smells.<br /><br />The food does have 25% protein but that's not really enough for former wolves.  Especially ones who, like ours, are getting on in years and hence, have a harder time absorbing the protein they do get.  In addition, relatively little of that protein is from chicken or other type of meats.  A lot of it comes from corn and gluten.  That's not necessarily a good thing.  And there is a lot of food coloring and preservatives thrown into the mix to boot.  And I doubt that the meat which this food does have is \"human grade\" like the meat in Canidae that we normally feed our dogs.<br /><br />Having said all that, this food is better than a lot of the dog foods you will find on the shelves.  It doesn't have saw dust for starters.  And, as a snack or treat it's probably the healthier alternative to the snacks you see on the shelves.<br /><br />And, since it smells great and is likely to for some time, that's probably a good use for it."}
