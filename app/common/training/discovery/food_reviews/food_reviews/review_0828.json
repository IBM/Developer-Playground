And then you also have dog owners, who can't cook their dogs meals, who can't spend a lot on dog food but just want their dog to be fed but also receiving the vitamins and nutrients that are available.<br /><br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I liken it to my friends.  I have friends who will go to Whole Foods and spend heavily on healthy products, while I have friends who will go the 99 cent store to purchase their spinach or salad or the Grocery Outlet because they are on an extreme budget.<br /><br />The fact is that in this economy, not everyone can spend that much and so, a lot of people look for what is best within their budget.  And the fact is that Purina Beneful products are cheap dollars cheaper than other brands.  It's affordable and when you scan through the ingredients, most will primarily look for the vitamins and just making sure their dog receives the nutrients that they need.<br /><br />I have fed my dogs Beneful before and they love it.  But I know at the same time that dog lovers are adamant to not feed foods with high fat and carbohydrates to your dog.  I use the human comparison that you have friends who can shop at Whole Foods and spend more, while you have the family on the budget purchasing .99 cent pizzas, TV dinners, bacon, rice and spaghetti noodles that are cheaper but yet are not exactly the healthiest.<br /><br />And I have friends who debate on this topic of food they feed themselves and food that they feed their dogs but what it all comes down to is what one is willing to spend or can spend for dog food.<br /><br />There are already a plethora of reviews for those who will tell you this Beneful product is not healthy for your dogs and then you will read those who are on a budget that will tell you that their dogs love it.<br /><br />For my experience alone, I know my dogs love Beneful.  But I don't purchase Beneful all the time.  We have purchased this product in the past to try out but also purchased for what was within our monetary budget at the time.<br /><br />Do I recommend it?  I recommend it based on price for those who are strictly on a budget, not based on ingredients.<br /><br />Purina advertises it as 100% complete and balanced nutrition with wholesome grains and real beef, accented with vitamin-rich vegetables.  For some that may be all that want to know about this product...low price and that their dogs will get a balanced nutrition.  And if that's the case, then go for it!  Otherwise, if you are a person who is hesitant because you want the best food for your dog, then already, you know the answer.  This one is not for you."}
