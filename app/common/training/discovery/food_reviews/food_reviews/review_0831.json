They are light eaters; they are in excellent physical condition, and we only feed them dry dog food (no soft food at all) and the occasional dog biscuit. We never had a problem with this arrangement in the fourteen years that we've had our dogs.<br /><br />I made the mistake of pouring some of this dog food into the feeder before it was completely empty. The dogs systematically tossed the old dog food pieces out of the feeder dish onto my floor. Then they started plucking out the chewy pieces, although they do seem to enjoy all the morsels...they just want to eat their favorite pieces first.<br /><br />As a result of their enthusiasm for the Purina Beneful, I swear they have pooped more in the past week than they have in the past year. Luckily, they did not develop diarhea (sp?) from the diet change.<br /><br />Obviously, my dogs love it, but I will not be leaving it in the feeder...we will have to switch to measured meals at specific times.<br /><br />On a side note: the resealable bag is not spillproof. I knocked the bag on its side, and it popped open, spilling the contents everywhere."}
