Junkin-Mills \"brookemom\"","HelpfulnessNumerator":2,"HelpfulnessDenominator":3,"Score":3,"date":"2012-07-28","Summary":"I like the bag, dogs like the taste, nobody likes the \"nutrition\"","text":"The best thing about this dog food is the bag's 'ziploc' style top, keeping dog food (& dog food odor) inside the bag instead of spilling out into my cupboard, and keeping any insects or cupboard-opening dogs out.  I love it.  Why doesn't every dog food bag have this?<br /><br />I also have to say that both of my dogs (greyhound and mix) love the food and gobble it up with relish.  But, you know, my teenagers would gobble up chips and candy and soda with relish if I let them.  It's junk food.  It may taste good, but it's empty calories.  Fine for sometimes (I mixed it in with their regular food), but not good as the only source of nutrition.<br /><br />And nutrition (or lack thereof) is the reason I wouldn't buy this food.  Just check the first 7 ingredients:  Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef [and then more fillers and chemicals].  Note that beef is actually the seventh ingredient, and that corn, meal, flour, and tallow (fat)are the main ingredients.  Gross.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Tasty and well-packaged junk food, but junk nonetheless."}
