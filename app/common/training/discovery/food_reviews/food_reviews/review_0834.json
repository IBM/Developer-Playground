The food is colorful and much more appetizing than many other foods on the market that are simply one color of brown.  Humans like variety in food so your dog should too, right?  The bag design is the best I've seen on the market.  It has a zip close at the top to keep food fresh.  I've bought more expensive foods that don't include that...genius.  I was all for the product...until I read the ingredients.  This food is not nutritionly sound.  Wanna guess the first three ingredients...ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten. These are not things you would want to feed your family, so why would you feed it to your dog?  My dog liked the taate, but in the future if I'm gonna spend this on food, I will buy a more quality product.  It is equal to just about every other store brand dog food on the market.  Good try Purina...I wanted to like Beneful."}
