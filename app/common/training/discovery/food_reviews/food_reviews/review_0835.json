In the past with other foods he has let it sit out for a few hours before finishing it. We started him on this type of dog food about 6 months ago because of some elevated liver numbers and his numbers are down now and he has lost a few pounds too. So, it's a win win for us. He loves the taste and it is healthier for him. 5/5 stars."}
