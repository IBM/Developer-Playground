My dog immediately began sniffing around the box and stalked it until I opened it.  Then she followed the bag around until it was time to eat.  Overall, she loved it.  Although she is not a picky eater, she was extra enthusiastic about this particular dog formula.<br /><br />A bonus is that this is readily available on grocery store shelves in case a reorder was not done in enough time.  Excellent product.  Pooch tested, mother approved.<br /><br />4- paws from the pooch.  4-stars from me."}
