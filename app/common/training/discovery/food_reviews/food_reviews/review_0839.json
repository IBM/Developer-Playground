Granted he only eats a few pieces when I put it on top of his canned food serving, but he does eat it.  (He will only it eat if I mix it with his canned food).  It didn't upset his digestive system or cause any poo problems.<br /><br />Our mutt loves Beneful Original Dog Food, but then she eats anything.<br /><br />It's packaged in a  sturdy plastic bag that closes with a zipper.<br /><br />The kibble  includes mixed sizes of crunchy pieces and semi-moist pieces.<br /><br />Satisfaction guaranteed or your purchase price will be refunded. Follow the guidelines printed on the package."}
