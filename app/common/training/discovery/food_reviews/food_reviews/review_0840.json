So they didn't have a lot to say about Beneful.  But, I take it as a \"two paws up\" when the bowl is empty soon after I fill it.  We have a pomeranian and a bichon and neither have ever had issues with weight.  But our bichon does tend to get rashes if she eats foods that don't agree with her.  We've generally just bought store brand dog food and that's been fine, but they poop a lot because of the fillers.  I noticed with Beneful, they still poop every day, but not as much and they seem much more energetic.  So, we've decided to stick with Beneful because the price isn't bad and it works for our pups!"}
