This coconut water is my husband's favorite, so we always have it in the refrigerator. Our family doesn't purchase soda, and now with the coconut water, we don't buy sports drinks, either! It's great to rehydrate, take to the gym, etc. And a liter is the perfect size-- I always found myself drinking at least 2 of the smaller ones so this is a more economic option.<br /><br />The items shipped fine, arrived in great shape. I'm on autoship for this product, so I don't even have to get it from the grocery store anymore."}
