Once I returned to the mainland I craved the flavor of coconut water. It is yummy and so refreshing. So I found some at the local grocery store, but it wasn't very good. Then I found this brand on sale at the store and tried it and fell in love. It is SO close to the same refreshing coconut juice I had in HI and I love it so much I have it ordered via the Amazon subscription service so that I can save a little $$$ too. Definitely recommend."}
