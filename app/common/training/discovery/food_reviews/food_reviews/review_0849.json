When I saw the chocolate flavor I was skeptical but intrigued. I'm a huge \"chocolate lover\" but chocolate and water in the same sentence sounded kind of weird. I tried it anyway and I am so glad that I did! WOW! This stuff tastes amazing and doesn't taste \"watery\" or \"watered down\" at all. It's has a rich chocolate flavor and is basically a dairy-free way to enjoy chocolate milk. Plus it has all of those good electrolytes :)<br />Definitely worth a try!"}
