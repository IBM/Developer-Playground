I had it over ice and could hardly get it down. I wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting. Delivery was not what I expected either. It came in a box with many other items, it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds. I think the UPS guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out. I guess the good news is it came quickly, along with the disappointment."}
