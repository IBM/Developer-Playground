I did a lot of research on coconut water before I purchased.  Zinco brand seemed to get better reviews, and people saying it actually has ALOT more electrolytes etc.  I have heard the benefits of drinking this versus Gatorade etc and wanted one that didn't taste like crap.  This is chocolate flavored.  Well , anything chocolate in my book is a winner.  the product arrived fast, and was packaged very well. I put a few in the refrigerator and in a couple hours, I tried one.  It didn't gag, or spit it out. It actually has a once taste to it.  Kinda like watered down chocolate milk.  Didn't taste any coconut flavor, just chocolate.  It filled me up, and seemed to make me have a little energy,  I plan on using these as after workout drinks, or even after too much  indulging in the wine, I think these would help!  Lol.  So I am pleased with the price, the packaging ( recycle) and the taste.  Also happy that this brand has been rated the best out of the top 3, for it's \"quality\"."}
