This drink is awesome. So awesome that I picked up the phone and called the friend who recommended it to me immediately after my first sip of it to thank him.  Everyone else who I've introduced it to is equally hooked.  The best ways to describe the taste are 1) the leftover milk in a bowl of cocoa puffs cereal or 2) upgraded yoohoo.  Also worth noting is that several people who do not like the taste of plain coconut water are in love with this chocolate version."}
