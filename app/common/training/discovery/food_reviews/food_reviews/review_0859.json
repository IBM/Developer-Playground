Though I should start with the fact that we don't really enjoy Coconut Water as a whole.  The regular (non-flavored) is great mixed with OJ or in a smoothie, but the flavor is not that appealing.  I know people love the stuff, we just have not developed a taste for it yet.<br />The Chocolate however, is not like typical coconut water as it also has some coconut cream and yummy dark chocolate.  The flavor is reminicent to Yoohoo, but without that milky taste or concerns of lactose digestability.  It is rich tasting, but not heavy.  We often drink it after a Bikram Yoga class and it hits the spot.  Not knowing much about cocounut water and it's benefits, we are learning quickly, there are many."}
