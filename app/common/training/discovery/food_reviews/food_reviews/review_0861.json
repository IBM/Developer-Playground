I've tried Vita Coco and some other brands and they were just \"ok\" for taste. In fact, they tasted flat and stale. This brand is very fresh and delicious, I am enjoying it so much! I've also tried O.N.E brand, and the taste is very similar. I'd buy both Zico and O.N.E. again..but Zico was a little cheaper! great deal!"}
