At the time, we were subscribing to Vita Coco.<br /><br />Zico has the fresh taste and consistency of real natural coconut water, whereas Vita Coco has a taste that suggests it is not as fresh or not as pure. Zico is more like fresh-squeezed.<br /><br />The only reason we had purchased the Vita Coco brand initially was that it seemed more available in local stores (as a backup, we love you Amazon and would never ever go to the store if we didn't have to).<br /><br />Zico packaging was the same as VC in my opinion and has no issues. We ordered the 33.8-ounce 6-pack to make the cost much less comparable to VC's 12-pack of 11.1-ounce cartons, and that seems to have been a happy accident as a space-saver (for us) in the refrigerator. Now one container looks right instead of 3 or 4 of the other."}
