Tried this on a fluke, while in an airport, and thought it was delicious. It tastes very similar to a Yoohoo, if you're familiar with that drink. Not quite the \"refreshing\" taste that I think the plain coconut water has, but definitely a tasty beverage that I find enjoyable. If you like chocolate, this is a good beverage."}
