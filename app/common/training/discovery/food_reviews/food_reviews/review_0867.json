Amazon is wonderful about replacements, but it's a shame the container isn't a bit more dependable.  I do recommend Zico as my second best choice....Amy and Brian being first, but talk about damaged containers!!  Had to cancel my purchases from Amy and Brian due to so many cans being dented and mangled."}
