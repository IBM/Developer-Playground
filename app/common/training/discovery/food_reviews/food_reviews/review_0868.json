Go with the Tetra-Paks instead","text":"I used to love Zico coconut water. No any more. This new formula is terrible. It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste. First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of \"natural flavors\", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA\">ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks."}
