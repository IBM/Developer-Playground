No thanks.","text":"The coconut water tastes good, it's like most other coconut waters on the market. Good coconut flavor, a little salty from the electrolytes, but overall pretty good.<br /><br />The pineapple \"flavor\" however, ruins it. At the price I bought it for, $6 on Amazon Warehouse, I'd buy it again, because coconut water is usually fairly expensive and the stuff is still decent, but the pineapple is like a bad afterthought, like your in-laws staying over for a week and then telling you they'll be here 2 more nights."}
