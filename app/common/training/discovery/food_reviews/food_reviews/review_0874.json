If I keep it room temperature and then pour over crushed ice it tastes just like chocolate milk which is novel as I don't consume any dairy. I don't think I would like it without being over ice, though. My kids use coconut water for workout recovery drink. Thought they might like this for a change but both find it too sweet to drink straight from the bottle."}
