I bought several brands and flavors and tried them.  I found the Zico to be the best tasting, and I really like the chocolate.  This stuff has great electrolytes and way more potassium than a banana ([...]).<br /><br />I keep them in the refrigerator and chug one after my runs.  If I run a race or drive to my runs, I often stick a couple in a small cooler to drink afterward.<br /><br />The price here is less than my local grocery store, and you can't beat Amazon Prime shipping."}
