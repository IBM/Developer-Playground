I don't love regular chocolate milk because it is much too thick and sweet for me. The Zico Chocolate is not thick at all, not overly sweet and NOT at all as coconut tasting as I feared it would be. I also found this drink to be a great energy booster between my mid-afternoon teaching schedule. I have to skip lunch and am running low on energy, but these electrolytes really help get me through to 6PM!"}
