I'm now about to order 4 more. I have lost 35+ pounds since mid-June and this drink has been a small part of that. The taste is so good that I haven't craved (or missed) regular chocolate milk at all. Typically I make one bottle last for 2-3 servings. You don't need a lot to satisfy your chocolate craving. Just give it a shake, open and enjoy. I hope they never change the recipe for this. I'm hooked."}
