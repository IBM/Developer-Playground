It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands. This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut. There's also no aftertaste, it goes down clean. Excellent beverage for rehydrating, especially when you let it get real cold. This is better for you than drinking gatorade. I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising. Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth!"}
