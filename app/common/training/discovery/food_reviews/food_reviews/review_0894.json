I drink a lot of coconut water after exercising. When I tasted it for the first time, the taste of zico was weird; it tastes like plastic mixed with coconut water- but it does not actually have any plastic. It is just that the coconut water has a different taste. It is not sweet and tastes very bland. But after trying out 12 bottles, I found my older brand to be very sweet. My husband likes Zico better so I guess I am going to alternate the subscription between Zico and the other brand."}
