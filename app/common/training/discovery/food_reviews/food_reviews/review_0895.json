In camparison to all others, I find ZICO's is the closest to fresh coconut water speaking from experience as I'm from an Island which frequently have coconut water as a beverage.  HOWEVER, their packaging certainly makes a difference DO NOT purchase ZICO's coconut water packaged in a plastic bottle as that's the taste you'll experience \"PLASTIC\".  ZICO's carton packing is much, much better!!!  ENJOY"}
