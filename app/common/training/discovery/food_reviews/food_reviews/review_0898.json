When I was a kid, I remember when my father would buy a coconut; we'd open it and drink the water inside.  There was never very much but it was delicious.  We bought a coconut maybe once a year.  Now it's readily available all over New York City.  I have tried all of the flavors and in my opinion the Mango is by far my favorite.  It is a wonderful balance between staying true to a real coconut water flavor and taste with a compliment of Mango flavor.  I am a huge fan.  I feel a burst of energy every time I drink it and it tastes so great.  When I have it in stock at home, I drink more of it than tap water."}
