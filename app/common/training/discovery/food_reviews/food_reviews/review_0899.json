This product is described as \"Pure Premium Coconut Water\" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is \"Plastic\".<br /><br />I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for \"Vita Coco\".<br /><br />I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is \"vent it out\" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.<br /><br />BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me."}
