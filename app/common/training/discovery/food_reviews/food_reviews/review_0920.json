They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein. They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT."}
