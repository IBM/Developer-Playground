I order by subscribe and save and I had to increase the frequency.  A real treat - love em!<br />Reviews are misleading.  I can tell that a lot of the reviews are for other flavors of kind bars, not cherry chocolate.  No one would say they are peanutty!  They are chocolaty and chewy and cherry-ie and delightful."}
