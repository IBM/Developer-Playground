Usually snack, protein or energy bars taste chemically. Not this one. It would be a convenient food to take to eat on-the-go. But, be warned. It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g). While I wouldn't eat these bars every day, for nutritional & calorie reasons, it's a brand I'll keep on hand for quick emergency hunger fixes."}
