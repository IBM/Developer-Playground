It has the right about of crunch and sweetness. I eat them midday and it keeps me full until dinner. Some people were complaining that the nuts in the bars were a bit stale. I didn't run across that problem, but they were sticky (just pop them in the fridge and they should be fine). You can buy them at kroger but they are much cheaper at amazon (almost half the price if you get a subscription).<br />I also had the dark chocolate cherry bar but I didn't buy it from amazon. It's really sweet and not to my liking. It's a good replacement if you normally eat a candy bar but that's just my opinion.<br />Go order some you won't regret it."}
