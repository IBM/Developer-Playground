They are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i then that's about right to cover the cost. At least this sight offers a great discount. This bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry, especially when you know you are eating something good for your body."}
