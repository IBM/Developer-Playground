I'm a hiker, figure skater and I also travel quite a bit with my job.  I prefer KIND bars for hiking because they are GOOD.  So often hiking food in general is loaded with salt just to give it taste and then it's still not very good.  I actually crave Kind bars.  They are good energy for skating and excellent to throw in before a meeting or take on the airplane in case I'm delayed.  Just good stuff and gluten free."}
