I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you're a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A\">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you're likely looking for."}
