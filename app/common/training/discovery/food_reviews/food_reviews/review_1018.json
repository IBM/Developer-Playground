I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind."}
