There's a Costco 30 miles away, but that seems too far to travel for a bag of chips.  I finally did the subscribe & save to get them on a more regular basis.<br /><br />I like these chips very much, they have good texture & flavor.  They hold up to dip as well.  I've tried the salt & vineger and the cheese flavors, but plain is still my favorite."}
