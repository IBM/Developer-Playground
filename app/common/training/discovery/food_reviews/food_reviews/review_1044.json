The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok."}
