Specifically, Bettermade BBQ chips, so as I'm trying to eat healthier I've tried to find a replacement for that craving.  I decided to give the popchips a try, thinking if they were at least okay I could replace my cravings for them.  They are better than okay!  These little guys are full of flavor and crunch!  And not to sound like a pig, but I could eat a half a bag of Bettermade in one sitting, but these little 8 oz bags, even though they are small, they fill me up!  I was shocked!  I am not kidding, I am eating healthier, giving in to my craving, and getting full from one small bag.  You cannot go wrong with these, even my kids love them!  I am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips!"}
