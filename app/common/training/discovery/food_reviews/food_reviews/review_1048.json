The BBQ are by far my Favorite. The BBQ flavor is a little sweet with a hint of smokiness, very addictive. They are light and as far as junk food goes they are healthy..'er than your regular chip. They do not leave your fingers greasy or any oily / greasy feel or taste in your mouth. That is because they are hot air popped and not fried. I almost ate the whole bag on my first taste; by the way it was the huge Costco size bag, twice the size of their large bags. With in two days I was back at Costco to by another bag. Like I said I just love these chips!"}
