Wow!  Excellent chip and of course you can enjoy it more knowing it has no cholesterol or saturated fat.  Fortunately the bags are small which helps you control your calorie intake.  But, they are highly addictive.  I have only tried the regular, but I will definitely be ordering some of the other flavors later on.  I recommend that every one try them, although at regular price they are quite expensive."}
