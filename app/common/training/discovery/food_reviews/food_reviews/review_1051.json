Tried them in NYC last week and of course can't find them where I live but thanks to Amazon.com I can get them whenever I want and at a great price too! The single bags were selling in NYC for $1.29 to $1.50 a bag. It's a lot cheaper buying the 24 pack here!<br />Looking forward to trying the other flavors, but so far Salt & Pepper are my favorite!"}
