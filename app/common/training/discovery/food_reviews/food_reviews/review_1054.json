All natural. Nothing artificial in 'em. No artificial colors or flavors<br />2. Low calories for a lot o' chips<br />3. Uber addictive taste-wise<br /><br />What more needs to be said? I'll be the first to admit, in spite of my being a weight loss coach in the evenings; I am not a big fan of diet food. I am a foodie. I love good food...love to cook it, love to eat it. Yet these, to me, are totally addictive. No fake diet food taste, tons of flavor. In fact, I HAVE to get them in the small bags or I will eat a whole large bag...it's one of those. Hickory, salty, hint of sweetness.<br /><br />They aren't fried or fake baked to taste fried.  They use a pressure cooker and the potatoes pop into a chip according to the bag.<br /><br />I got the automatic shipment of them from Amazon because it reduces the price by 15%and if I get 2 per month it allows for free shipping and, with the no tax, I can't get them in the stores that cheap and they are delivered automatically to my door this way.<br /><br />Also, these have a lot less salt than the old chips I used to eat...but they don't taste like its missing<br /><br />Negatives: These are still hard to find in some grocery stores."}
