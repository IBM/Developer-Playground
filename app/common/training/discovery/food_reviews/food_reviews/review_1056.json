They are very good and don't taste greasy at all.  One bag has a lot of chips in them and can be filling.  They are only 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat and they don't taste like you are eating something healthy for you.  I love Cheetos and can't have them anymore and now love these chips.  The flavoring is not very strong but strong enough."}
