I've tried some other flavors too but found salt and pepper the best so far.  Original comes a close second for me.  Salt and vinegar is a very close third. Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips, but am I glad I did!  The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive."}
