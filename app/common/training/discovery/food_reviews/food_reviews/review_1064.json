But BEWARE of the SOY in them if you have a soy sensitivity, like I do.  I ate quite a few and had a bad reaction before reading the label and realizing that soy was an ingredient.  I just never imagined soy would be in a potato chip!  I learned my lesson!  My kids love the chips and, I agree, they are YUMMY!  I'm sad that I can't have them!  :-("}
