I like how they are portioned and one bag is only 2 points if you're doing Weight Watchers.  My last order however, arrived at my house in an open box with a huge amount of tape.  This resulted in me getting a case of crumbs.  I was very disappointed because usually they come in safe packaging. I give the chips 5 stars, but the packaging this time around was horrible!"}
