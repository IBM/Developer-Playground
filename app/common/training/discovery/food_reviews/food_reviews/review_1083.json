It has a sweet spiciness, but nothing is overpowering; just the right balance of smoke, sweet, and spice, they're all good, but the barbecue has the most robust flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are a good choice for those who are trying to trim a few pounds. They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips. I parcel mine out into sandwich-size reclosable bags to help with portion control, and still manage to have a satisfying snack that fits in my program."}
