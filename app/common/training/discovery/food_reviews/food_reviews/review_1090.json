They are not your normal chip, and do not have the greasy-ness about them.  They are light and crunchy and much healthier than your regular chip.  Most people really like them once they try them and get over the 'Oh, it's a HEALTH food' thing!  They are not as healthy as eating fruits and veggies, and are still chips, but they are a much MORE healthy alternative to your regular chip.  And they do still have an excellent taste!  Sour cream and onion is amazing, but so are the other flavors!  (Whatever your person preference is!)"}
