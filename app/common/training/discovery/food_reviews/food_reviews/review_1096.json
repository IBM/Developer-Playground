Not the best thing I've ever tasted, but pretty good. The first couple bites are confusing and strange but it gets better. They get really good after the first ten. I got my box of chips yesterday and I've already eaten two bags. They are yummy. Much better for you than regular chips. I don't feel guilty at all for eating so many. The bags are a little small though. I'm still debating on whether or not twelve small bags of chips are worth $25."}
