Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear \"all natural no fake flavors\" - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced -highly processed, sweetner from starch and a source of carbs.<br /><br />So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine  I just wish they wouldn't try and pretend to be something they are not - they are  snack food - we expect some downside"}
