Then they added these sweet potato chips and they're the only ones I buy now.  The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened."}
