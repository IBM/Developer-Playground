I don't bother buying any other kind of potato chips.  These have a great taste and no messy greasy fingers.  I was shocked and disappointed to find out my local grocery suddenly stopped carrying the chips.  Thank goodness for Amazon. Now I can get the chips right to my door--cheaper than I was paying at the grocer!"}
