These salt & pepper chips are very spicy, so you only want to buy these if you REALLY like that black pepper burn.  Also, there IS enough GLUTEN in the product to cause a reaction IF YOU ARE \"ALLERGIC\" TO GLUTEN.  I found that eating them once in a while was not a big deal, but eating them frequently truly was/is a problem for me.  They taste GOOD, but be careful if you have food allergies.  Just sayin'..."}
