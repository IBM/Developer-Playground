To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The texture, which is between a chip and a rice cake, is a bit thicker than usual but has a very satisfying crunch. It also helps the chips to keep from crumbling too easily. The sea salt and vinegar flavor is the perfect combination of salty and tangy, and while these are quite filling, I don't fill sick after I binge on a whole bag the way I would with ordinary chips. I never liked baked chips much (the texture was just off for me) but I think I might actually prefer these to ordinary potato chips."}
