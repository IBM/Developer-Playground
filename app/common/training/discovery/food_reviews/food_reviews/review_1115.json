I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer... besides this flavor. The smell is actually so awful that it kills it from the start. If you could manage to eat them after that, well good on you. As for me I am dissatisfied with this flavor in specific. I would still recommend popchips as a whole."}
