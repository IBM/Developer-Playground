They are a nutritional powerhouse and great for diabetics. I eat them in a variety of dishes to stay lean and fit. I also love chips. Imagine my dismay when I thought the best of both worlds (sweet potato chips ) ended up tasting not much like either of those things. I ate three bags on different days and on an empty stomach just to make sure I wasn't mistaken. Not even my pit bull would touch these (he's a bit of a snob though). These just sit on the cupboard (on death-row) awaiting their expiration date ."}
