They taste good too!  Kinda sweet, kinda salty.  They're made with sweet potatoes so it makes sense.  Another interesting Popchips feature is that they are \"popped\"(hence the name, again, makes sense) rather than fried or baked... gives it an oriental rice snack kind of consistency.  All in all very pleased with these, give them a try for yourself, whether a health nut or not(a .8 oz bag of these is about 1/3rd the fat and half the rest of the nutrition facts numbers of a full oz of Lays for the record)."}
