They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)"}
