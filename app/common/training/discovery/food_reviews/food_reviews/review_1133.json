With that said, I was so excited when I heard Pop Chips had come out with a Jalapeno Chip!<br />I am sad to say the Jalapeno chip just misses the mark. Both my husband and I agreed there is something off about them and seeing as we usually love other kinds of jalapeno chips, these were just not good. Save your money, don't get the jalapeno chips flavor."}
