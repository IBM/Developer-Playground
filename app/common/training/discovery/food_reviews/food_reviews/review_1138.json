They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!"}
