They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!"}
