I loved the popchips themselves and its a great idea. I dont much care for this chili lime flavor though but i can definitely see myself getting other popchips flavors that i would prefer more.<br /><br />The flavor is evenly balanced out between spicy (chili) and sour (lime). I personally dont like sour chips much but these werent too bad in that sense. The chili is quite spicy though. It worth a try unless you really hate spicy chips or sour chips."}
