It took little over a week for him to eat 2/3 of the box...  ;P  Me eating a bag like every other day, not realizing my supply was rapidly diminishing....<br /><br />  Needless to say, I will absolutely be buying myself a case of these in the very near future!  A great snack, and a wonderful change to the normal pop chips!  :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy"}
