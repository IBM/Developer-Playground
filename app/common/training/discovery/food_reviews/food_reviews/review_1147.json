Probably!","text":"SWEET POTATO<br />Pros:<br />- Amazing Taste<br />- Good packaging, almost no chips ever broken, all full shape.<br />- Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)<br />- Perfect serving in the bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hard to open the bag<br /><br />These chips are now my favorite brand, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big \"retail box\" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.<br /><br />For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other branded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good."}
