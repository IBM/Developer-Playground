After eating two bags and giving a few to friends/co-workers I think they are above average. My friends/co-workers liked them.<br />Still processed food but better for you than regular, oily potato chips. For what they are they work.<br />The price is OK. Maybe they are more expensive to make so not a big hit here."}
