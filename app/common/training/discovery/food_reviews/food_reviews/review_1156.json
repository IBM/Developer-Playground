Potato chips, tortilla chips, I like them all.  Popchips offer a chip like substance,with the promise of low fat.<br /><br />They crunch like chips but don't quite have a chip like texture; it's closer to a rice cake.  The seasoning is decent as well.  They have a surprising amount of a great sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients are okay as far as healthiness.  I like that rice flour is the first ingredient rather than potatoes or corn.  You still get oil, although less than normal chips.  There's more salt and sugar than I would like.<br /><br />In the end I found myself munching through the case of 24 fairly quickly.  Popchips taste good and aren't as bad for you.  Check them out!"}
