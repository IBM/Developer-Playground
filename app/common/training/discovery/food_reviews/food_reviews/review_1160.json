Most 100-cal snacks that I have had are tiny portions, but these chips are a normal sized serving.<br /><br />They aren't my favorite Pop Chip flavor, but there definetly is a lot of taste. It is strong flavor that grows on you. When I first tried them, I would have said 3 stars, but now I really like them. A few other Pop Chip fans I talked to rate them at 3 - 4 stars too.<br /><br />In the end, they are pretty not-too-bad-for-you, but the taste is, well... a matter of taste."}
