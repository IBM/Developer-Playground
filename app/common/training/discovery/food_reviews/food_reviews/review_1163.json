From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich."}
