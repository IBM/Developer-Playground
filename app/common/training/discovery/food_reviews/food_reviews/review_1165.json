It is a very nice union of salty and sweet with a light sweet yam flavor.  Some sweet potato chips are too strong tasting for me, but not these.  These are light and airy, but still provide a good crunch.  Kind of a cool feeling on your tongue too, like bubbles evaporating. I think these are my new chip because my waist certainly can't afford the fat in traditional chips anymore."}
