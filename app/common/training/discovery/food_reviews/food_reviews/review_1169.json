DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something \"snacky\" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really \"bad for you.\"<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product."}
