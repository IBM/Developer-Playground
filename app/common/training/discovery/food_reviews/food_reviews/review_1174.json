I have to rate these 5 stars because most flavors are amazing. I love popchips. The bbq and cheese ones are my fav, but recently ordered the sweet potatoes and found them to be lacking in taste. In fact, they tasted just like all the other types of chips, lacking flavor. Looking forward to trying the chili lime."}
