My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal. However, I happily ate a whole bag just by itself, and it was fun.<br /><br />The chili (spicy) comes on strong at first, then you taste the lime, then it ends with a spicy limey aftertaste that is quite pleasant. This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs. If you are on a low-carb diet, that eats up a large chunk of your daily serving, so beware! Because, like with most chips, you can't just eat one chip."}
