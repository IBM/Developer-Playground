Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these \"natural\" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.  Obviously, something along the lines of an apple or some plain popcorn would be a healthier choice for a snack, but certainly would not be as enjoyable!"}
