I love the Salt & Pepper though all flavors are good (according to my husband since I can't have any dairy I did not try those flavors).  While the chips are high in sodium, they are a nice healthy alternative to grease and salt laden fried potato chips.  Don't expect a traditional potato chip or even a pressed chip like Pringles.  They are different but delicious.  A 0.8 ounce bag contains only 100 calories and 10% of your daily salt (2000 cal diet).  The bag says they start with a potato and \"add a little heat and pressure and.. pop.\"  Well, not quite.  The ingredients list: Natural Potato Ingredients (Potato Flakes, Potato Starch), Safflower Oil and/or Sunflower Oil, Rice Flour, Sea Salt.  If you need gluten-free, they are gluten free BUT they are made on equipment shared with wheat."}
