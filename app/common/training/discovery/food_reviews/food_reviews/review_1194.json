SO GOOD. Really, I just like that these are crunchy, salty and yummy. They're an easy addition to my lunch when I need some extra snack items and want something to look forward to during the work day. I wouldn't call them filling but they're good to tide me over for an hour until lunch or I get home to start dinner - I do run a lot though so maybe that's why."}
