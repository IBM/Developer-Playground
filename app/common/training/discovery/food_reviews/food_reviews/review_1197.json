Cheddar is my favorite, but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.  Just a word of caution....you'd better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor. All in all, these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips."}
