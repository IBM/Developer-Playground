The flavor does NOT disappoint - tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite \"chip\"! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!"}
