So needless to say I love Popchips. When I saw a new flavor available on Amazon of course I had to try it. Chili Lime sounded interesting, and it is indeed an interesting flavor. There is a big hint of lime along with the \"chili\" flavor which is hard to explain. I think this is one of those things that you just have to try for yourself if it sounds interesting. They're decent enough that I will finish off the box, but I can't say I would buy this flavor again."}
