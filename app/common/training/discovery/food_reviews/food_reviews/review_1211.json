Forget meth...  NOTHING is more addictive than these \"chips\".  Heed these words: these \"chips\" will cause the downfall all modern civilization.<br /><br />In all seriousness, these things are very tasty, and nowhere near as bad for you as an old fashion potato chip.<br /><br />My wife picked up a small bag in an airport vending machine while on a trip.  She saved a few \"chips\" for me to try when she got home.  I was so impressed with the taste, and the nutrition label, that I immediately thought of my dad.  He loves a good snack item (don't we all?), but with a recent diabetes diagnosis, and the ever increasing challenge to lose a few pounds, his \"snacking\" options have been getting pretty sparse.<br /><br />So I shoot him a text message, and include a picture of the nutrition label from the back of the bag.  Seconds later I get a text message back:  \"Are you kidding?  We're the reason Pop-Chips stock doubled last quarter!  Put all your stock into BBQ Pop-Chips. They will replace crystal meth soon!\"<br /><br />Now, I haven't tried the other flavors yet.  If you look through the feedback on the other flavors, not all of them appear to be smash hits.  But you can't go wrong with Original.  Definitely give these things a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
