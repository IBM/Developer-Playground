They are 3 points plus points on Weight Watchers and are much cheaper than the WW branded BBQ chips. My favorite flavor is the salt and pepper.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />They created new flavors and I enjoy most of them. However, the Sweet Potato Popchips are now my least favorite Popchips. The flavor and texture just didn't translate well to the Popchips style chips. They tasted odd, almost burnt. Salt and Black Pepper as well as Cheddar remain my favorites."}
