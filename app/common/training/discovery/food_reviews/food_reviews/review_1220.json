Which makes the money saving 24 pack such a deal.  The problem with the the 3 oz. is that you eat them until your in a coma and the rest go stale.  The 1 oz. allows you to stop sooner without wasting good food.  I don't like the extra bags to through away but the 3 oz wastes food and money.  I actually found that at the time I purchased these the 24 x 1 pack here was cheaper than the 12 x 3 pack.  My only hope would be that they introduce a larger resealable for less.  These chips with their simple salt and pepper flavour go with almost everything.  So enjoy.  Bonn Appetite!"}
