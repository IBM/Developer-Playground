Ordered these through the Popchips website and it routed me to Amazon.  So delicious and at 100 calories for the snack size bags...I can finally eat chips without the guilt!  No shipping costs so runs right around a dollar a bag.  LOVE THESE!!!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Ok, I freaking love these, have I mentioned that? I had to subscribe to make sure I always have them around to snack on.  Totally addicted, thanks Popchips! :)"}
