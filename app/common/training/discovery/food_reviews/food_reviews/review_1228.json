I love that there is a healthier alternative that actually truly tastes good!  BBQ flavor is excellent too.  Although I love salt and vinegar chips, I wasn't crazy about their version.  The sour cream and onion and the cheddar were also so-so.  Out of all the flavors, original is my favorite.  You don't feel you're compromising anything with this alternative chip.  Way to go PopChips!"}
