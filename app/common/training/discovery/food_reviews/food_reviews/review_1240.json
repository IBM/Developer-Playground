These Are Good","text":"I normally HATE fake chips.  I don't even really like real chips, but if I'm having a chip, I don't want any of those taro, cassava whatevertheheck kind of chips.  They border on disgusting.  I was tentative to try these when I got them.<br /><br />I was surprised.  These chips are thick, airy and wonderful.  The BBQ flavor is the closest I've had to \"real\" BBQ chips.  I could eat a whole bag.<br /><br />I wouldn't call them a healthy snack, but they are more healthy than regular chips and quite enjoyable.  I can't believe I like a fake chip!"}
