I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice."}
