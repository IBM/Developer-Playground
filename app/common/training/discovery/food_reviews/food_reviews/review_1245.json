I picked up my first bag at a store about 80 miles from home because they are low in fat.  The flavor is excellent and they are crisp and fresh packed in what looks like a foil package.  At only 4 grams of fat per ounce, these are the best flavored chips I have found.<br />Buying from Amazon brings the chips to my door at less cost than buying at a local store and I don't need to spend my time or money for transportation to get them. They are well packaged in the box and each bag is sealed with a volume of air that keeps it from squashing and breaking the contents in transit.<br />All in all a great flavorful low-fat snack that hits the spot.  if there is any negative at all, it is that with 12 bags in the cabinet, I need to ration them to myself so I don't pig-out on them.  Enjoy !"}
