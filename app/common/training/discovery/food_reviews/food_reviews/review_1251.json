I use it on a piece of bread with honey, so good. It is also good for Asian style sweet dishes, gives an excellent flavor. If you using it as a dietary supplement by taking a tablespoon; it can be quite difficulty to swallow because of the texture. One thing about this oil is it doesn't refrigerate well and at 76 Fahrenheit it melts completely."}
