It is a much better value on Amazon than anywhere else I have seen. I recently went to an over-priced \"Parisian\" hair salon to get a keratin treatment and it left my long, natural hair severely damaged, breaking, and feeling like straw. Yes, I am still miffed. My sister insisted that I ditch all the expensive treatments and commercial products and just let my hair go natural and treat it with coconut oil which she uses on her gorgeous, long, black tresses. In desperation, I ordered several bottles. They came surprisingly fast and I immediately tore open the box and after inhaling the euphoric aroma for a half a minute, I slathered it on my hair and scalp and left it on all day (while indoors). After I washed it off, my hair was visibly silkier, shinier, and had much less breakage. I'm in love! Also, I use it on my skin and it absorbs well and leaves my skin supple with a slight smell of coconut. Love the price, love the product. Can't go wrong."}
