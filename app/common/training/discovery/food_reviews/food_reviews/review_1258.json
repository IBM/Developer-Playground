The \"Extra Virgin\" label is just for marketing purpose and to make the product itself more appealing to buyer.<br />I have no way to verify if this coconut oil is truly organic or cold pressed, since I wasn't in Philippine at the time they made it, but<br />I hope they are honest.<br /><br />Anyway,<br />I like the taste of this oil, I mix it with peanut butter, and I wish if I can find a coconut oil with a stronger coconut taste. For me the coconut taste is not strong enough. I tried different brand from amazon, and all has the same taste. I tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI\">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a> and has the same taste as this one, except this Nature's oil brand is sometime cheaper<br />I like it, and will keep doing so as long as they offer it at a competitive price."}
