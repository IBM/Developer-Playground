Amazing stuff","text":"I've been using this coconut oil every chance I get. It does wonderful things for my hair, and skin (conditions, moisturizes it without any buildup). I'm in the process of transiting from my chemically treated hair and was informed that pure coconut oil is great for natural hair, and wow I am impressed. It's a very light oil, unlike olive oil, which is great, but thicker and heavier.  I haven't used it in my food yet.  Also there is not a coconut scent to it, and it does not really have a taste to it."}
