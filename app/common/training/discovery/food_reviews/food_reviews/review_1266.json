I have been reading about the uses and was ready to try it.  The first thing I did was try it on my hair. I can't remember if I left a review on the other Coconut oil I bought but I have hair past my waist and I was in my pool on a hot day and when I finally got out I was exhausted.  I wanted to rest before I showered and passed out. I went to sleep with all of that chlorine in my hair and my hair was a dull, brittle feeling. I had just received the oil 2 days before. So I rubbed it through my hair. My hair seemed to be bright and soft. It even looked a little more blond. I have been cutting up veggies and spraying the oil on them while cooking. I bought the \"Misto\" and filled it with the Coconut oil. But the best thing so far...Is toast with the oil on it. There are so many benefits of the Oil and it is delicious.<br />***Here is the EDIT***9-5-12<br />I found a new delicious way to use this. You know the Olive oil bread dipping with garlic? Well, I made spaghetti and I put my seasonings and started to put my olive oil in my round dishes and right then I stopped. I put 2 tbsp of EVOO and 3 tbsp of Coconut oil the grated the garlic and added my Parmesan cheese. OMG, it was so wonderful.<br />Thanks to all of you who inspired me to start using this stuff."}
