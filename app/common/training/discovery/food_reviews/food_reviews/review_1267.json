I've tried numerous products on her to try to remove the little bumps, but nothing had worked. Almost immediately after applying a very thin layer of coconut oil on her skin, there was an amazing improvement! The bumps lessened, and after a week they had completely disappeared! After seeing these results, I had my son use it, who has eczema on his hands.... and again, the eczema cleared up almost immediately.<br /><br />I personally use the coconut oil on my hands to moisturize them, and also put a tablespoon of the stuff in my coffee every morning to help with my metabolism as I have thyroid issues."}
