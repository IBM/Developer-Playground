I use this brand on my daughter's skin from around 5mths to now 11mths. She had severe Ezcema and it kept recuring whenever she got hot. her skin in exactly like a baby's skin should be - soft and smooth since I started using it. Plus I'm always smelling her bc she smells so yummy. OFF TOPIC: I also give her lots of pure coconut water and she loves it<br />For me, I spread it on my toast, sprinkle on my salads, saute with it - scrambled eggs are THE BEST when fried with this. I even put a few teaspoons in my hot choclate (yummy). It's the best for retaining moisture in your hair so I also use as a hot oil treatment before bed and wash off next day. I let my hair air dry and it's the softest its been in years. I lather with is right after my shower and wake up with soft supple skin. I keep one in the bathroom, another in the Kitchen and one in my daughter's room. I will NEVER be without this super product.<br />Oh and my mom swears by it too as it's helped control her blood sugar (she's a diabetic) Her Doc is so impressed he took her off Metformin."}
