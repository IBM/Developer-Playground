I was hesitate at first after seeing a friend use it on his hair (He's Spanish so it works with different hair types)I thought his hair took well to the product because of the completely different texture, but I tried it anyway.<br /><br />I must say my hair absolutely loves this stuff. It not only moisturizer my hair but it makes it really soft and manageable. It also gives my hair shine, body, and luster. Although, I have flakes here and there the amount of dandruff has decreased dramatically, when I use the product consistently.I have even given it a test run by allowing my hair to go without it for about a week. I only used regular conditioner on my hair. The results were terrible. My hair became dried and rough. It lost the luster and shine and it was no longer silky to the touch.<br /><br />This product is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone with any hair type."}
