I give a spoonful to my dog a day and it keeps his coat shiny, his breath fresh, and he LOVES IT!  For me I put it on my curly hair to tame the frizz, on my skin as a moisturizer, and I take 2tbs a day as a weight loss supplement...you can't go wrong with this product.  It tastes great and I don't even like coconut, amazing to scramble eggs with though!"}
