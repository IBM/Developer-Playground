Makes for a nice change from olive oil and it has a lovely flavor and scent.  I also use it on my lips when a I need a quick moisturizer.  This product does change very quickly from solid to liquid when it is warmed.  That is great for cooking, but when using it as a spread, it can be messy.  The fridge can make it too hard and leaving it on the counter in the summer will turn it to oil. I have not found the happy medium yet, but I like the product so I will continue to use it."}
