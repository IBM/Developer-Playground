My fav way to use it is for lotion. After I shave my legs and I put this stuff on it helps my legs stay so smooth and soft. My hair does not grow back so prickly. I also love how when I go into the ocean after I shave my legs it does not burn anymore! I also use this for baking food. My food comes out more moist, especially cakes. There are so many good health reasons to use coconut oil. For skin and for eating. wow I love multi tasking:)"}
