I'm transitioning from using over the counter products with more natural alternatives and I truly am pleased. After about a month of using it as an overnight prepoo and after wash sealer I have noticed a change for the better in my hair. Coconut oil is the only oil that can penetrate into your hair follicles. My hair holds moisture a lot better than ever before, is stronger, shinier, smoother and softer. It makes a great hot oil treatment in tandem with amla oil. The smell isn't strong - it has a light nutty coco butter scent.<br /><br />Also, I found using this with shea butter liquifies it easier when rubbing your palms together. I've only used this product on my hair but I would love to try it with cooking."}
