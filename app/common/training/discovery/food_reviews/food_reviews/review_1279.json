I cook with it almost every day and take spoon fulls of it as well..I decided to try this brand based on the trusty reviews here on amazon and I am amazed..This stuff is simply delicious. Im surprised how different it is from Jarrow..It definitely has that more natural taste that the reviews here said. I will never get another brand of coconut oil."}
