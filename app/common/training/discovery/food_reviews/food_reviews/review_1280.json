This oil is easy to scoop out and it melts in your hands so doesn't need to be continually microwaved. I ran out of anti-wrinkle cream, so I decided to put this oil of my face instead, and it makes it very soft and supple and hopefully it will keep the wrinkles at bay as well. On a whim, I decided to use some while frying rice and it came out absolutely delicious. It gives a hint of coconut flavor to dishes cooked in it. I'm ordering another jar because I don't want to cook with something I'm scooping out to use on my face and hair.  I will be ordering many more jars."}
