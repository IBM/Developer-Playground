I coom with this and used it to mix with shea butter when i was pregnant for preventing stretch marks and itching and it worked great.  I use it for my baby's ezema now too, its greasy on the skin but soaks in quickly.  When cooking I use it in place of butter and olive oil and it has actually helped with my weight loss and my husbands, of course you have to eat healthy too but it made a noticeable difference in a two week period of time."}
