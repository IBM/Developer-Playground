I use instead of butter on toast, vegies, rice, cakes, etc. Not good for frying, except eggs. No crispy browning. Contains medium chain amino acids that works wonders on brain neuron connections for Alshiemers and weaned  babies. Lack of these, may even be a factor in causing Autism. Olive, and other oils have none. Non-hydrogenated!"}
