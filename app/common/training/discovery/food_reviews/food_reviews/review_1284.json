It gives me a lovely coconut fragrance, and my skin and hair haven't been this soft in years! I am also going to go out and get a small container so I can carry a bit around in my purse for chapstick. No more dry lips for me! I highly recommend this product to anyone (Well, unless you hate coconut. Then you might not be such a fan of the smell. It is pretty subtle, however, and reminds me of summer :D )."}
