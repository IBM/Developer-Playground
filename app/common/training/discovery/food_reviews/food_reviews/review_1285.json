It is still sitting in the cupboard with only one use. Later, I read an article and found that to get the benefits of coconut oil you need it unrefined. When I opened the lid the smell of coconut assured me that this oil was the real thing--I love this stuff! I've used it so many different ways; my favourite ways to use are as a sugar scrub or as a deodorant--melt a few tablespoons of oil, put in 1/8 cup baking soda and cornstarch, and a couple drops of tea tree oil."}
