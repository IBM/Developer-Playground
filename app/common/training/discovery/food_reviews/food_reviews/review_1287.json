Antibiotics, skin creams, food changes, special shampoos, ugh you name it, I've put more money onto my dogs rear end then I have ever spent on myself, and to top it off all his skin issues make him smelly! I read online that coconut oil helps solve a multitude of issues inside and out, and since it's something all natural, I feel better about using it in general.<br /><br />I put it directly onto his legs and lower back just today, the fragrant coconut oil really helps with cutting back on how smelly he is, He seems less restless with his itchy spots - but only time will really tell if this stuff is really going to make any progress for him.<br /><br />The other reason I purchased this was because I wanted to make my own handmade soap, and it worked just fine for that use!"}
