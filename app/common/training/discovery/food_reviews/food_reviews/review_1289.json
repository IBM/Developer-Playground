It is the best moisturizer for my face and hair (I have tried almond, shea and grapeseed too), and not to mention, it feels so smooth, creamy and totally awesome on my hands, fingertips and feet.  Also, this is totally natural and cold pressed.  What more can you ask for?  No bad odors either (unlike shea oil)!  I have used the Nutiva organic coconut oil too, and Nature Way just feels a lot better and totally awesome on my hands.  I cannot comment as far as cooking is concerned, because I go through these jars very fast just using them for hair and skincare and scalp message.  I use this and pure almond oil alternatively on my eyelids and under eyes.  Try it by all means, if you are thinking about it."}
