I wasn't sure what I'd gotten myself into when I first tried a spoonful.  The texture reminded me a bit of crisco (uh!), but it immediately started to warm on my tongue and there was a heavenly, light coconut aftertaste that reminded me a bit of an almond joy bar (without the almond or chocolate).  I prefer not to eat it by the spoonful because of the consistency, but really like spreading it on a graham cracker, the taste of which reminds me of coconut cream pie with a graham cracker crust. I also like cooking with it, and didn't notice coconut-tasting chicken. I recently ordered a larger amount of coconut oil and tried a different brand, but I prefer the Nature's Way flavor. I'll use the other brand as a moisturizing cream, and order more of the Nature's Way for eating and cooking. It's wonderful for moisturizing after a shower, or for using right before bed when the coconut scent is restful. This is my favorite brand, and I'm sticking to it."}
