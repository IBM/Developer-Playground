Normally I have really dry skin on my nose at forehead to the extent that it would start peeling off in the middle of the day... and no lotions would work! :( Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin fairly normal in this regard -- especially with the dry, harsh winters of IL. Any coconut oil would do, but this one is low cost, high quality, has fast shipping. Basically, once this jar runs out, I'm ordering it again."}
