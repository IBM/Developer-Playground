I used it immediately on my pregnant belly, thighs, eyes, and a dry patch under my mouth. I also heated up a tiny bit (a little goes a long way) in the microwave to apply to my hair and ends to freshen up my 3rd day flexi rod set. I can just tell this is my new beauty staple! My cat tried to eat some too and that just goes to show because my smart fat kitty would never try to eat any hair product, but he knew this baby was naturally edible lol."}
