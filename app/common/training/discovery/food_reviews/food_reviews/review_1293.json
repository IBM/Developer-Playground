I have Keratosis Pilaris and I have tried different products for years trying to get rid of it or improve it even a little, to no avail. I have tried countless lotions, including KP Duty. About a month ago I stumbled upon an article of someone claiming coconut oil cleared up her keratosis, I was skeptical but figured it was worth a shot. I have been applying coconut oil to my skin every time I take a shower and also mixing in about 1/2 a tablespoon with my dinner for about a month now.  I also added a daily multivitamin into my diet. The progress was slow but now all of a sudden my skin has shown incredible improvement. I would say my keratosis has cleared up as much as 75%!  I am shocked and very happy.  Such a cheap alternative to all the expensive lotions too!! I will continue to use Coconut Oil for life."}
