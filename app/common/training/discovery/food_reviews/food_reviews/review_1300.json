I have tried various so-called virgin coconut oils before, but they smelled so rancid within one week of opening, that at one point I resorted to rendering my own coconut oil, but that was so time-consuming and tedious. Some other brands were masked by additional scent. For a while I was discouraged from trying any coconut oil, until I read reviews on this one. I tried one, and I was hooked. It smelled so HEAVENLY like the fresh coconut that I remember. Every time I would apply on my skin or hair, I would be reminded of our rice-based coconut desserts, so for purposes of having a dose of 1-2 tbsp per day, it was also not hard for me to take it plain, although the lack of sweetness quickly brings me back to the reality that it was not coconut-y dessert I was eating, but that's easily solved by adding muscovado or brown sugar. This is certainly the best coconut oil I have had so far, and the ONLY one I have tried and actually finished (I used to stop using those previous ones when I could no longer stomach the rancid smell, which usually brought the content down to only 25%).  This is also the first coconut oil brand that I actually tried to bake with (although it quickly used up my tub). I have subscribed for this to be delivered monthly, but I might change that to a more frequent supply of fresh tubs. After I was truly impressed by it, only then did I check out where it came from, and was surprised to find that it came from my country! Keep up the good work of making available a quality product to the whole world!"}
