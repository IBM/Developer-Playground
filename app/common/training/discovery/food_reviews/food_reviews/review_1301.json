If the room is even slightly warm, it liquifies until it looks like water. In the fridge, it turns rock-hard. I am frequently moving it hither and thither to keep it at the consistency I like.<br /><br />The last two shipments I received were incorrectly packaged. Since it was summer and quite hot, the coconut oil arrived in its water-like state. Whoever packed them put them on their sides and consequently, several of them which were also not adequately sealed, leaked and soaked the box they came in. Amazon replaced the 3 leaky ones. Unfortunately, the same guy must have packaged them. He (she) put them in upside down. All 3 leaked.<br /><br />On the brighter side, I bought it because a doctor on line said it help cure her husband of Alzheimer's. I've been giving it to my husband who suffers from a different type of dementia. It hasn't cured him but his decline seems to have slowed and he likes the taste of it.<br /><br />Another plus is that the price at Amazon is about half of what I have seen at stores and it has many other uses."}
