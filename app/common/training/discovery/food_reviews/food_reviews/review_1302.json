My skin became noticeably itchy and scaly after using only coconut oil as a sole moisturizer for a month.  As soon as I ceased and switched to lotion, my skin became rehydrated.  It also clogged the pores on my face.  I got a couple of pimples on my cheeks where I have never had pimples before.  I'm not sure why it has not worked as well for me as others.  I have ceased using it as a skin moisturizer but will continue to apply it to my hair a few hours before I shampoo and condition my hair, hair is noticeably softer and more manageable with this product."}
