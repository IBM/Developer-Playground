It tastes like coconut! I only take a teaspoon a day so I can warm up to it. After about 3 weeks I should be taking a tablespoon or 2. The price is right on this oil.<br /><br />Shake: Amazing Meal Pomegranate-Mango Superfood Powder, frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, Big Train Strawberry Smoothie Mix and Nature's Way coconut oil. This is a thick, thick shake that will fill you up for hours.<br /><br />Update 10/08/12: I have found by far the most efficient and delicious way to get my daily 1 tablespoon. Take 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and heat until it's clear and oily in a dish. Mix in 1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. Stir until the peanut butter is evenly mixed into the oil. Eat on whatever. I have found that if I put large amounts on each bite, it is good sized or a bagel. The coconut oil mellows out the flavor and stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth quality of the peanut butter, so I can eat much more on a bite than if it was just peanut butter. Delicious protein and good fats."}
