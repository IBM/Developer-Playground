I use it to *shallow* fry lot's of food. I take it also just as it is when I am feeling lazy and don't feel like eating. After a 4 day juice fast, I started a vegetarian diet, with next to no meat (I currently don't eat meat or eggs, or any dairy products), HIGH plant fats, probably a couple pounds of fruits and veggies every day, and lots of coconut milk. Oh, and lets not forget beans and rice, unprocessed kinds of course. Despite my high fat diet, I am dropping fat weekly. While there may or may not be a profound effect with this oil, I can safely say that it hasn't added any fat. In fact, I am pretty certain that it aids in fat metabolisation. Plus, you get a rare type of MCT with this product, which makes up nearly 70% of the fat contained in the oil.<br /><br />On a side note... DON'T BE AFRAID OF PLANT FATS!! You want to lose weight? Stop eating processed foods (ALL TYPES), eat beans and bulk rice (Wild, Forbidden, Long Grain Brown, Red Rice etc..), nuts/seeds, nutbutter and coconut! Oh, and veggies too of course. Its easy AND CHEAP to eat well. It took me quite some time to be able to figure out how to eat so well on a less than stellar budget, but it can be done! &lt;3"}
