This Coconut oil is amazing, a gift from God to us.  I used this coconut oil mix with a little baking soda to make homemade deodorant and it works unlike the ones I bought from the natural store.  I use this coconut oil to moisturize my skin, treat my hair, and to nourish my inside by taking a teaspoon a day.  This is heaven sent, and it helps to kill candida and a whole lot of other stuff! Simply put, its just good for you.  This particular brand is better than others I've compared it to.  It has more of the good fat and it tastes better.  5 thumbs up for EfaGold, and the price on amazon is fabulous too!"}
