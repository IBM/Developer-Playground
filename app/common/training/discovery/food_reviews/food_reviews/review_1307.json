I bought this back in January originally for my hair since I'm an African American woman with 3c/4a natural hair. and while it has done WONDERS growing my hair, I've been even more amazed by its other talents. If you use it as an occasional moisturizer it will leave you skin sooooooo soft. I also use it now as a substtute of oil/butter when I'm using my frying pan. You can hardly taste it, and when you do it doesn't taste bad at all. And it works better than oil and butter in my opinion. I'm not a chef but it seems to still burn a little bit when you use oil or butter. With this coconut oil, i just pour a dime size in the pan and use a paper towel to distribute it evenly so it give it a nice gloss. I let it heat for just a few seconds, add my food, and then wa la! no burning, and no more unnecessary calories. I will credit it (along with my diet and exercise) for allowing me to lose 30 pounds this summer. WOOH!"}
