And I highly recommend it for women of color, who is looking for that perfect hair conditioner that moisturizes, gives a beautiful shine to your hair, and has a nice fragrance.  It is the all-purpose daily moisturizer for your skin as well. I had been looking for oil that would keep my coils hydrated and I found this coconut oil through Amazon. You will not be disappointed."}
