It is not only good for you, it has a wonderful flavor in low temp cooking(from eggs to oatmeal), used as a spread, in morning smoothies(adds a crunch as well because it hardens when cooled) and in baking!  Amazon has the best price consistently and Natures  is the best product.  I have it on my auto ship program and love it!"}
