I had developed some allergic reactions to some items in man-made lotions and my naturopath recommended using organic coconut oil instead.  I LOVE this oil.  It has a light coconut smell that does not linger too long.  I use this all over including on my face and my skin has been more moist (no longer do my legs get dry looking), my face less oily and with fewer blemishes.  My husband has noted that my skin looks younger and fresher.  It DOES take a while to soak in so I have had to adjust my routine a bit to avoid getting oil on things but have yet to stain any clothing or other items.  I tried a couple brands I found at the store prior to ordering this after reading the reviews and have found the brand I will remain loyal to in Nature's Way Effagold.<br /><br />I have also used this in cooking and love the light coconut taste it adds to food.  I still use EVOO for certain things as the taste just compliments certain foods better, but this oil has definitely been added to the diet and is in the rotation."}
