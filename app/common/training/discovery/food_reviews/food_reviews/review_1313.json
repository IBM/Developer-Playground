Coming from the land of coconuts, I found this to be a superior product similar to what we get there - a high quality.  Some refined oils have a heady aroma which gets \"cooked\" out.  This one retains its aroma even after cooking. I have used it for sauteing, pan-frying and seasoning with no flavor loss.  Tastes even delicious when raw.  Bit on the expensive side but I'm ready to pay that extra penny for great flavor."}
