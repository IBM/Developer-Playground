I previously used the Spectrum Naturals brand from a local grocery chain, but gave this one a try because it was a little less expensive. This coconut oil is far better in my opinion. It smells great in the jar, and smells AMAZING when cooking. I've used it for almost every meal I've needed oil for since getting it: browning meat, making crepes, even homemade marinades. When cooking a recipe with many ingredients the flavor tends to get lost, but for less complex meals (like lime shrimp I sauteed last week) you could taste a hint of coconut in the meal. What a fantastic addition! So far everyone, even our kids, has had nothing but rave reviews about it.<br /><br />It's summer and very warm here, so when we got our first jar it was completely liquid. It was a surprise to me, because every jar I'd bought at the store was always like a thick white paste. No worries; if that bothers you, just put in the fridge and it'll harden right up."}
