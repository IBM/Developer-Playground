Tastes delicious. I even eat it by the spoonful. Sits on my kitchen counter, and never goes rancid. Solid but melts at 72 degrees, so it's easy to use whenever I need oil to cook with. Plus Coconut oil is very good for you. My cholesterol is under control, my veins and arteries are clear. My weight is normal. All these things have happened since I started using this oil. I highly recommend it."}
