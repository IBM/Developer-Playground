It arrived when it was estimated to arrive, it was packaged properly. My only concern at first was that the oil was in liquid format. But after reading the the information on the back of the jar, it did state that it will become solid at room temperature. So I will wait to see if it gets solid. I have ordered coconut oil in the past, but it did not smell like coconut. This product actually smells like coconut. I love the smell. I have opened the jar at least 5 times while writing this to take in the aroma. So excited to try my new coconut oil on my newly natural hair."}
