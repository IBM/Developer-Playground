But, I used a small \"turkey baster\" I bought from the salon supply store for acetone to add some to my hair potion and it smelled awesome enough o eat!  Even though I bought it for cosmetic purposes, I just may have to try it for cooking! Anyway, I also added a bit that was lingering on the foil seal to my curly baby hairs around my face and they were instantly soft, shiny ringlets! There's is quite a good amount in this sized container to last a while too. A little goes a long way! I am impressed with this product and will be buying it regularly in the future!"}
