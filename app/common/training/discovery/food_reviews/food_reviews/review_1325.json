It is very tasty. For cooking...you can use a couple of tablespoons of this to fry pancakes, stir fry or any other recipes that call for butter or margarine. I almost never use margarine now. I even put it on corn and my breakfast toast. Coconut oil contains Medium Chain Triglycerides which is known to aid in weight loss and lower cholesterol levels. For skin...Since hearing about coconut oil, it is the only thing I use to moisturize my skin. I even put a little on my face at night. My skin is even more beautiful now. For hair...after I wash my hair, I rub a little in while it is still wet. After it dries, there is so much sheen and shine, there is no need for anything else. FABULOUS!"}
