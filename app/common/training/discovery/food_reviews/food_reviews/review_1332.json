Also, it has a relatively low smoke point. Those facts out of they way, this is a very high quality coconut oil. It smells wonderful and everything cooked in it takes on a hint of coconut. I use this in my coffee, fry eggs in it, saute spinach in it, as well as enjoy a tablespoon of it before my workouts. I have read that there are non-food related things you can do with this as well (good for skin, etc) but I have only experienced it through a culinary lens."}
