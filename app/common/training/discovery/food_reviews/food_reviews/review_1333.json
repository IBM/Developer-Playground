It moisturizes my hair extremely well and doesnt leave a look of build up and absorbs beautifully. I have 4a hair in lower back length locks and absorbtion is something that is a must for anything i use in my hair.I am excited to continue using it and I also have used it on my skin. I absorbs well to the skin too leaving my skin supple but not greesy.<br /><br />If you dont like the smell of coconut it may not be the product for you. But if you enjoy the smell it is very pleasant and it is not over powering.I will try mixing this into a whipped shea butter blend also for skin and let you guys know how it come out :-)"}
