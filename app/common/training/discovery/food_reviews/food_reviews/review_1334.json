I love coconut flavor, so this was easy for me to take. I love it. I cook Shirataki noodles in it, eggs, anything. I especially love to eat hot cereal and put a dollop of coconut oil in it. It's really delish. I hope all the health claims I read are true! Start slow, though. The first week I had a lot of diarrhea. I think your body takes time to get used to it; I don't have that problem anymore."}
