I had lab work taken in February prior to starting the use of the coconut oil. Then I started using the coconut oil, in my food and on my skin. I used the whole 16 oz container in March. Then I had my labs redone in April 1st. My A1C in February was 9.7 the most recent A1C is now 7 which is almost normal. So even though I was also taking my medication, the addition of the coconut oil was the miracle in my book. I have signed up for subscribe and save and will be using the coconut oil with a shipment monthly. I was hesitant at what the results would be as I have tried other things, but it works. Used it on a skin rash as soon as it started and within two days it was gone. Try it for yourself."}
