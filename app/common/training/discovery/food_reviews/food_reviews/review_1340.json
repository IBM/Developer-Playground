AMBROSIA!","text":"After reading several of Bruce Fife's books (and they were wonderfully easy-to-read for the non-scientific type), I decided to give coconut oil a try to help with losing weight and getting my blood sugar under control. As a non-medication taking, recently diagnosed diabetic, I want to try whatever natural remedies I can find to stay off insulin and other diabetes meds, in addition to meds for cholesterol, etc. I tried taking a teaspoon or two with meals and a teaspoon btw meals and my blood sugar numbers were noticeably lower the same day. (Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste! I love coconut so I was able to eat it right from the jar, but I also tried it spread on a Wasa Crisp bread--WOW, what an easy way to get MCFAs into your diet! I will definitely be using this instead of any oils for all my cooking needs (except a little EVOO mixed together with this for salad dressing.) Also, I'm using on my skin and it feels really soft, plus you also get the internal benefits from using it on your skin! GREAT PRODUCT!"}
