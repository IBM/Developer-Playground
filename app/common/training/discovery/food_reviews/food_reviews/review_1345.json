I was excited to find these on Amazon, but i was a bit disappointed.  Unlike the bars I have purchased locally, the bar cannot be extracted from the wrapper intact; they stick to the wrapper as if they had not been kept in a cool dry place.  Except for the annoyance of peeling them off by pieces from the wrapper, they are still quite tasty."}
