I first tried them at Starbucks, where they cost $2.45 each, plus tax. Amazons price is $1.48 each, almost one dollar in savings! I eat these for breakfast on the go, or for a quick pick me in the afternoon. The Mango/Macadamia Nut are the only ones i have tried so far, but I absolutly plan on trying the other flavors."}
