It is visually & aromatically appealing and the crunchy fruit and nut taste is truly sensational. I have one every morning with a 4oz. probiotic yogurt and my coffee. It is very satisfying on many levels as well as healthy for me. Kind told me that the price I paid for these on Amazon is excellent since they typically retail at $2. per bar in stores. These are so incredible that I possibly could go into 'withdrawal' without my daily Kind fix!"}
