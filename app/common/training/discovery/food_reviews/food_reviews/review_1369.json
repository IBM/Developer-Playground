The combination of flavors not only satisfies my hunger but also satisfies my desire for something sweet. What turns me off about most fruit/nut bars is the syrupy sweet substance that holds the ingredients together. I don't taste that at all in any of the Kind bars. I have this particular variety on auto delivery."}
