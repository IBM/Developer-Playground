These KIND bars are one of the only available bars on the market that actually ARE delicious, nutritious, and filling.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate and peanut butter fiend, and before I discovered KIND bars, I had abandoned my years-long quest for a bar that contained chocolate and peanut butter without being a glorified candy bar devoid of nutritive value.  I have one almost every day for breakfast, and for hours afterward I feel both satisfied and energetic, in contrast to the jittery 30-minute sugar rush followed by a swift crash provided by other brands."}
