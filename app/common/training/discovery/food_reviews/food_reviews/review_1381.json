I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of \"wilt\".  The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy.  What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.  Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off.  I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.  I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store."}
