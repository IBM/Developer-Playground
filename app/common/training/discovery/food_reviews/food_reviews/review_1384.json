So I've tried a lot of bars and frankly they range around mediocre,  pretending to be something (chocolate!)that they are clearly not.<br /><br />So what are these bars like?  Great!  Really delicious - full of nuts you can see and taste,  not too sweet,  as often these bars are, and it has protein!  A happy find,  we bought a box and will buy more,  I can see it becoming a staple in our cupboards.<br /><br />May 2010 - on to my third order,  so this is a really great snack in our house.  The protein really does help fill you up,  it's a perfect snack,  and all of us think it's delicious (though my son does prefer the macadamia passionfruit, this one has protein and that makes it a much better bar for me and my husband and our low sugar tendencies)"}
