They are are moist and sweet.  My previous favorite was the KIND Almond and Apricot and I didn't think they could be outdone, but I was wrong.  The Mango Macadamia are now the slight forerunner.  I find myself craving these bars all of the time.  The KIND company has outdone itself; bars that are yummy and good for you. What could be better?"}
