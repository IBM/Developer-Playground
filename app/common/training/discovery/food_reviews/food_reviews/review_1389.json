WOW!  These are amazing!  They serve as a total meal replacement when I'm on the go, but still taste good enough to be considered a snack.  I have now also tried the cranberry/almond (which are tasty, but sticky enough that I have learned not to eat them in the car)and the Vanilla Blueberry Granola and Cinnamon Oat Cereal as well.  These are GREAT products and I recommend them highly.  I've never written a review for anything before, but \"Kind\" words needed to be said!!!"}
