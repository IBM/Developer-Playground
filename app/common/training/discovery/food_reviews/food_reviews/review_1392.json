Do you know those things?  Starbucks sells like Mocha and Vanilla cold drink things - I have no idea what they are, precisely, but I know they are AWESOME.  So I figured this thing - this Cappuccino can thing - would be like that.  And to some degree, it is, only to a lesser degree.<br />-<br />First off, the can says Cappuccino, but it tastes like no cappuccino I ever had!  One of the ingredients is cocoa powder, and I'm pretty sure that's not an ingredient in cappuccino!  First ingredient is cream or milk - I forget - so just FYI this is a creamy-coffee drink - it's not like black coffee or anything.  It is very much like the Starbucks drinks I love, only it tastes more watery.  The starbucks drinks have that super-creamy and sweet and strong coffee flavor that punches you in the mouth!  This drink is more like being hit in the cheek with a slice of lemon.  No, it doesn't taste like lemon.  I'm trying to make this entertaining.  Is it working?  Anyhow - this drink is OK, but it's not GREAT.  I liked it well enough, but if I'm going to buy some pseudo-coffee drink in a can, I'll reach for the Starbucks bottle instead.<br />-<br />Also - I got a slight headache after drinking this.  Not from the cold.  Probably from the massive amount of caffiene!  But I survived."}
