If you like a little bitterness, then you'll prolly love this. Thankfully no can taste, which was a concern of mine.<br /><br />Otherwise not much to say - plain, no flavors, although I'm sure you could add your own if you want i, but taste fine just like it is.<br /><br />The bitterness was just a hint, which many regular espresso drinkers probably wouldn't notice - for me, it was enough to take off a star, but was still good. Don't know that I'll be buying a lot of it, but for that allergy or headache, when I use that caffeine, it would be great to have around to get rid of those."}
