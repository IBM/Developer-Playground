Not too large, so none of that icky-stomach feeling.  Yet it perked me up mid afternoon and tasted great.  I also liked that it is lightly sweetened, but not super sweet like those Starbucks drinks that feel like pure sugar.<br /><br />I do think this is better ice cold in the can instead of over ice: with ice it loses it gets diluted quick. But the shape of the can makes it quick to chill and keep on the go.<br /><br />Much better than the illy espresso shot, which doesn't taste as full-bodied as this.  Before, I was hesitant about stocking up on these, as they are pricey, but if it keeps me from running into a 7-eleven or AM/PM to buy one, it saves me the element of risk of running into all that junk food! So, keeping this at home cold is a treat that doesn't involve having to look at a rack of Snickers and being tempted to buy one of those too!  It will be cheaper in the long run!"}
