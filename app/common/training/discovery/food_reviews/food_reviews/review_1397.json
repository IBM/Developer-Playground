Finally canned coffee thats pretty good!","text":"I really might buy more of this so I do recommend it. Most prepackage beverage coffee just lacks that fresh brewed taste. However I was pleasantly surprised to find this one has such rich smooth flavor. It was not bitter and left no aftertaste. It is not the best in  the world I am sure but at least it is quite drinkable."}
