It's both smooth and sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients include coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum and carrageenan. There's 81mg of caffeine per 8.45oz can.<br /><br />It's one of the better choices from the illy issimo line of canned coffees. The flavor is nice and I would drink it again."}
