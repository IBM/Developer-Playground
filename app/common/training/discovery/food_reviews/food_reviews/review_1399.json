The only thing I can see missing was the nice head of froth that you usually get with the hot version.  Flavor was right on and it wasn't overly sweet like some drinks are which was a plus in my book.  It was a great cold ice coffee drink on a nice warm early Summer eve.  I would most certainly buy these again and am very happy to have given it a try before turning my nose up at it.  Yumm!  Mayhap a bit of real cream on top next time with a bit of cinnamon will make it perfect."}
