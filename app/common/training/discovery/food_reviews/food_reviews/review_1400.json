I usually drink Starbucks Mocha Frappuchino in the morning, so I am used to the taste of something sweet and creamy and perhaps am spoiled, this just tasted strong and bitter and blech after having that every day.  If you are a black coffee type person and don't do sweeteners, than this is definitly for you though.  It definitly gives you a jolt!  Just tastes like crap to me!  Blech!"}
