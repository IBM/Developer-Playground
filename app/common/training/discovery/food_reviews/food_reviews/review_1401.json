It's a little creamier and sweeter, but still contains traces of a good solid black coffee. I don't drink a lot of coffee mostly because I find it so difficult to find the blend of blackness and cream and sugar. Temperature is also a difficult think to master (it always seems too hot or too cold!) However, this coffee blend is a masterful mix of my favorite sweetness, creaminess, and blackness. It's rich, but not too rich. It's sweet, but not too sweet. And no bitter aftertaste! I refrigerated it and thought it tasted great cold.<br /><br />With that being said, I would never spend $2 on a little tiny 8.45oz can of it. But if coffee is important to you, this is a great-tasting product. And a nice--albeit unhealthy--way to boost your energy!"}
