This illy iced coffee just left a little to be desired for me, which is where it loses its two stars.<br /><br />If you're a true coffee connoisseur, you might find that you prefer this brand over Starbucks. What I've read and heard indicates that this is Italy's preferred brand of coffee. As a frugal Foodie, even though I like Starbucks, I'm typically loathe to dish out happily for the prices they charge for their products. Even still, in this case, Starbucks wins, at least as far as my palate is concerned."}
