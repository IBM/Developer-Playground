Generally in the morning I drink a cup of hot chocolate or chai tea latte. When I go the hot chocolate route I like to put about a third of a teaspoon of instant coffee in the mix. As I said I'm not an adventurous coffee imbiber. Thought I'd try a liquid coffee form and this coffee cappuccino drink seemed like it would be an 'adventure' to try for someone who is not coffee oriented. As an additive it was great. Because the cappuccino mixture includes some milk and beet sugar, it complemented the hot chocolate's taste. I used about an eighth of a can per 12 ounces of hot chocolate. Gave it a little zing. If you are not a coffee drinker, but like to add it to something for a bit of that coffee taste--this is a great product."}
