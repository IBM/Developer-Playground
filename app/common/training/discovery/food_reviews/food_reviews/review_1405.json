I decided to give this product, the \"illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce\" a try.  Below are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I like the idea of a coffee drink in a can.  It gives me the option of just bringing it with me and drinking it when I'm ready rather than having to stand in line every morning (or buying a coffee maker) to get my morning shot of joe.<br />- The portion size (~8.5 ounces) is good.  I wouldn't mind an even larger size, but this size is big enough to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The coffee and chocolate flavors were too delicate for my taste.  I prefer the milder coffees, but this cappuccino was a little too mild for me.<br /><br />Neither a pro or con:<br />- You can drink the product cold from straight from your refrigerator, but in my opinion, it tastes better served over ice.<br /><br />Overall, in my opinion, this product's strength is its convenience and portability, and its weakness is that doesn't taste as good as the freshly-made alternatives.  While it's a little too weak for my tastes, if you like cold/iced coffee, you should give it a try to see if it works for you.  Three stars."}
