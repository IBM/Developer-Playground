It is usually Starbucks Frappuccions. I buy them by the case. Caffeine is my one and only addiction. Cold coffee is my treat. I am familiar with illy coffee. I have bought their espresso to use in my stove top espresso maker. When I run to the drugstore and they do not have Starbucks, I grab illy in its place.<br /><br />Taste wise this is just OK to me. I like it but I do not love it at all. It was easy to drink but did not leave me craving more. I did however buy a case of their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UOA31I\">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Mochaccino, 8.45-Ounces Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. I like the other one a lot more. This one is a tad bland to me where the mochaccino is a bit more bold and flavorful.<br /><br />After drinking Starbucks Fraps, these are a lot healthy for you. Starbucks is just a tad over an ounce more in size but has 180 calories where this has 100. Also, the fraps have 31 grams of sugar where these have only 18 grams, which still is a lot.<br /><br />I like illy cold coffees but will stick to other flavors. Again, this one is OK but not one I would keep stocked in my fridge. I already have made the switch from Starbucks to illy since they are a lot healthier. Still not healthy but it is my one and only treat of the day."}
