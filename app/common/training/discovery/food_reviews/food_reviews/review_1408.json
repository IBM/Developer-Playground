I don't consider the Illy Issimo Cappucino to be an extreme coffee drink but it is one that I enjoyed.  I frequently use Illy coffee in my Gaggia machine to make espressos, cappucinos, lattes, and so on so I'm very familiary with the brand and their coffees.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed this beverage first chilled then served over ice.  The perfect blend of coffee, 2% milk, and cocoa powder, were excellent but seemed to be a mocha rather than a cappucino.  My home-made cappucinos are frothy where this was not.  I'm puzzled by the \"do not shake\" statements printed on the can.  I would think that shaking the beverage in the can would froth it up a bit to make it more cappucino-like but they must have their reasons for not wanting it to be shaken before opening.  Regardless, this is a very good coffee drink that I will be enjoying more of in the future.  I hope you will enjoy it as well."}
