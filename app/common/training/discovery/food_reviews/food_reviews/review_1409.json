There's more coffee flavor, and the chocolate essence is more like cocoa than chocolate.  If you've ever made hot chocolate with unsweetened cocoa powder, you'll know what I mean.  At 100 calories and only 6% carbs, it's almost health food!  I like that it's not too sweet.  I'll be buying this in the future."}
