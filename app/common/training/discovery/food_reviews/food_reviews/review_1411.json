Not so much with illy Issimo.<br /><br />Flavor:  As good as Starbucks, Lavazza or any other premium coffee<br /><br />Taste:  Illy has tried to minize on the calories (only 100 cals) - so it is not that great on taste, compare it with the starbucks Frappacino which is made with whole milk and obviously more filling<br /><br />Calories: 100 calories<br /><br />Ingredients:  Unfortunately it contains cellulose which is a factory product, so does starbucks and others, but a premium product like this should have not included this kind of ingredients.<br /><br />Overall - it is low on calories and OK on taste.  Loses a star for the taste, and a star for the ingredients"}
