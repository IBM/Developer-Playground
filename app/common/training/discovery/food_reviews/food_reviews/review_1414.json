I would drink coffee while working and become so inspired by my work that my coffee frequently became cold. But I drank it anyway. It tasted good enough that I soon experimented with commercial cold coffee drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.<br /><br />The popular brand, however, doesn't do much for me so I began to look around for a more enjoyable substitute and decided to try illy issimo cappuccino, an Italian espresso drink made with low fat milk and cocoa. I loved it! This drink has a rich, deep coffee flavor that is not overbearing but lingers until you reach for the next drink. The taste-rich drink, not particularly healthy, is made of natural Arabica coffee.<br /><br />This drink is made by illy cafe, a company started in Trieste, Italy, the Adriatic port town where coffee first entered Europe. The company was started in 1933 by Francesco Illy, the man who developed the modern espresso machine. The ready-to-drink product is distributed globally through an agreement with Coco Cola. The drink is available in 140 different countries.<br /><br />I enjoyed this drink right out of the can but others get more pleasure by pouring into a glass and adding ice. The drink does come in a narrow, smaller 8.45 ounce can which does not excite me but I guess it's done for style reasons. Overall, an enjoyable drink."}
