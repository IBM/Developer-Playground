At 100 calories a can and 1.5 grams of fat (in the video I misread it and said 15 grams of fat, NO NO! It's 1.5) it's a nice cold pick me up on a hot afternoon. The can says do not shake, important since my first impulse is to shake coffee drinks.<br /><br />Although Jim and I did not taste much of a cocoa taste, we would still recommend the cappuccino. The espresso taste is strong but not bitter, the drink is very smooth and tasty."}
