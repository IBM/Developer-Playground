The results are products that are elevated over their peers.  Now, no one is going to do a blind taste test and confuse these canned drinks with a fresh brewed cup, but that isn't the point.  illy's cappucino drink mixes strong brewed coffee (espresso-style) with milk, a touch of cocoa and not too much sugar (usually overwhelming sweetness to mask poor quality coffee is the biggest failure of coffee drinks).<br /><br />These ingredients blend together to produce a drinkable and refreshing beverage."}
