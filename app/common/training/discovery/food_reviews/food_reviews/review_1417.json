If I had to describe it, it's basically very similar to Starbucks' mocha frappuccino - milky, very sweet, with a good coffee base smoothed out by a little cocoa.  (Of course, if you find that flavor combination too milky or too sweet, then this isn't for you).  The finish leaves some coffee and sweet notes, and the 8 ounce can was just right for a tasty, 100 calorie liquid snack.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the product currently seems overpriced at over $2 per can.  I didn't knock a star off for the price, however, because those can change frequently.  If you like the sound of a sweet, milky cappuccino drink and can find this at a price that works for you, then I highly recommend it."}
