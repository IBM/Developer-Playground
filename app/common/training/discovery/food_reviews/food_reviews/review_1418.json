I try to keep a can or two around in case civilization breaks down and I either want a little morning jolt before the aliens attack, or if need something to trade with the survivalists and atomic mutants.<br /><br />This aluminum-clad product is a pre-made, sweetened coffee drink not unlike the gooey Starbucks bottles that they sell in convenience stores, though not as syrupy, and maybe with better coffee. I found it pleasant, and refreshing on a hot afternoon. Worth checking out, although the coffee flavor could be more pronounced. Kind of weird that the drink is licensed to (or owned by) Coca-Cola, from Italy, and manufactured in Denmark. But hey, it that's the flavor of globalism, it tastes pretty good!"}
