Even in those rare places without a Starbucks store, there is ground, instant, bottled, or canned Starbucks products on store shelves. Meanwhile, Illy, a brand well-known in Europe, is trying to make further inroads into the American market. This Illy Issimo Coffee drink reminds me of a more concentrated version of Starbucks bottled Frappuccino. However, it is less sweet and the coco makes me think of a milk shake. It tastes good and the espresso provides a great pick-me up, though to me I can barely taste any coffee, yet alone espresso, which is something I would expect from a coffee drink. I might grab a can of this on though go, but I doubt I would order an entire case of this particular drink."}
