Issimo's \"Illy's Cappuccino:\" A Critical Review.","text":"I'm not a big fan of iced coffee, this week being the first I've ever drank cold coffee intentionally!<br /><br />Illy's Cappuccino has a nice flavor but not as versatile as iced tea but this drink tastes a lot like Miami's version of \"caf&eacute; con leche\" so this will go over well down here.<br /><br />Illy's Cappuccino...4 stars."}
