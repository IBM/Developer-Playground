Having 100 calories per can, made with low fat milk..it's showing 19g of carbs and 18g of sugar.  A nice \"treat\" for a summer drink.  Has a nice smooth cocoa/coffee blend.  Not bitter at all, but you get that \"expresso\" taste, clearly.  I have bought Illy brand coffee before and this is rich and mellow like what I had bought, enjoy!"}
