As an International Flight Attendant, she has traveled a lot to Europe and says that this illy cappucino tastes like a \"European\" coffee. When I asked her what she meant by that she said that it was smooth and mellow. I concur. And I guess it makes sense that it tastes \"European\" because illy is an Italian company.<br /><br />This tastes nothing like a Starbucks French Roast or Sumatra, for instance, which are both dark and bold tasting. The illy Cappucino is way more subtle in its flavor. Subtle but still there is a distinctive coffee taste that I enjoyed. There is added sugar however and for me, it's a too sweet. I do not normally sweeten my coffee beverages much if at all. Many people do sweeten their coffee though and for those, the sweetness may be just right for them.<br /><br />The ingredients seem pretty straightforward and that is good. Regarding the sugar, a single serving, 1 cup, contains 18g of sugar. A teaspoon of sugar is approximately 4g so this essentially has the equivalent of 4.5 teaspoons of sugar per serving.<br /><br />I drank and I liked. But I would not purchase again because of the added sugar. But if you don't mind the sugar and want a convenient way to enjoy a cappucino coffee beverage, you'd probably like this illy coffee drink."}
