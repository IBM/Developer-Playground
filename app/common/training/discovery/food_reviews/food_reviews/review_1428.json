It doesn't stand out to me anymore than any of the other cold coffee drinks I have purchased, including Starbucks and Seattle's Best. I have recently been purchasing the generic brand at our Aldi grocery store to save money and it's just as good as any of the brand name ones. So, I would drink this again, but I wouldn't make an effort to purchase this brand. I'm happy with any cold coffee drink, and purchase according to price."}
