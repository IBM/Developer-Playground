I did however make the mistake of shaking the can before opening it, I then read the instructions and had to wait a few minutes before opening it, also I split the drink in half and tried it warm and cold, it is definitely better warm than cold in my opinion. I would like to see it in a bigger size, but it is still a very good drink."}
