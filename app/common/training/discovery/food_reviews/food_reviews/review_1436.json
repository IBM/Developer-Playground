The drinks from Starbucks are slightly sweeter and have about 25% more calories than this Cappucino.  While I prefer this drink, it is far from tasting like a freshly brewed iced cappucino.  The flavor is not as pronounced and the aroma is very weak.  There is a noticeable earthy undertone that tastes a bit like wood.  One can has a little over 80mg of caffeine."}
