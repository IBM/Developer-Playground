Not that illy issimo Cappucino is bad.  I like that it has the cream in it and is not straight coffee, but it's still not quite up to par with some other coffee drinks I've had in the past.  Decent, but it's not very strong in flavor, which is nice if you're not a big coffee drinker.  Could have used a little more flavor for me and been slightly less of that \"out of a can\" type of coffee drink.  Best chilled, for sure, but even then it was still a little lacking."}
