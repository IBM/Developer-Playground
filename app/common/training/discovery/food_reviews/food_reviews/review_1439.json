It's Cappucino because the writing on the can says it is but, Cappuccino or not, it's made out of coffee, a little cocoa, some sugar and milk so most ingredients are present. Only the the fresh taste and the fresh aroma, the froth and the Cappuccino steam are missing.<br /><br />Now, if we are to compare bland make-believe Cappuccinos, the 'illy issimo' that comes in a can is almost indistinguishable from the Starbucks version that comes in a bottle. How do I know? I did a blind test and I found it was difficult to tell which was which except for the Starbucks being a little sweeter and bolder but only a very little.<br /><br />My fair rating should be a bland 3-stars (It's Okay). Drink the 'issimo' if you must or if the real thing is unobtainable but it's coffee that comes in a can so don't expect the impossible."}
