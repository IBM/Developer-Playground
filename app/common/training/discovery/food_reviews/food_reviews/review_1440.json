After having it in the refrigerator overnight.<br /><br />Overall with my experience with others; I give it an ok - there are better ones out there, however, this one packs a lot of punch with CAFFEINE even though it only packs 100 calories in one can.  In my humble opinion, for those who just can't wake up in the morning and have a long day at work or for College/University students would find this handy for their term exam time for it WILL KEEP YOU AWAKE!<br /><br />It was not bitter, but it did taste old even though the expiration date was well ahead of time; it did have something of a old-coffee taste that had been sitting around for quite some time, however, that could be Coca~Cola / Coke's version of how they created this Illy Issimo Coffee Cappuccino. It was well balanced but I did find the after-taste somewhat bothersome, that which I am exceeding picky about.<br /><br />For want of a better words - When one drinks this, the balance of cream or milk, coffee, and sugar were all done exceptionally well but, the coffee itself to me, personally, tasted something that had been sitting for several days - but that might be just me."}
