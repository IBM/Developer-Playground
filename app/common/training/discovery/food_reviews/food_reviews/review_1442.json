It isn't as icky sweet as some of the Starbuck frappucino's and such, so for me that's a plus.  It has a nice coffee flavor...not too bitter and just a small amount of sweetness.  This drink isn't for those of you who aren't really coffee lovers that only tolerate really sweet coffee drinks.  It tastes like coffee...just perfect for the true coffee lover.  The size is just right with 81 grams of caffeine for it 8.45 ounces.  This product is manufactured in Denmark for the Coca-Cola Company.  They are a little over $2 a piece on Amazon.  That's a little pricey for a regular habit, but it is much more competitive than a $5 drink at the coffee shops.<br /><br />Overall, it was tasty, and I would recommend it."}
