I preferred it over the Caffe blend that I had previously tried.  I drank it cold and it was enjoyable.  No fireworks of the taste buds or immediate desire for more. But, it tasted okay.<br /><br />Final impression based on my one-can taste test: Just okay.  I may or may not buy one if I was in the mood for a cold coffee drink at a convenience or drug store."}
