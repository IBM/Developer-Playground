It's got a definite cappucino flavor, though the flavor of regular coffee is stronger than it is in a really good cappucino.  It's not very creamy, which is a bit disappointing.  According to the nutrition facts, it's healthy enough that you can drink it guilt-free, though it is fairly sugary, if that's a concern.  Overall, I enjoyed it but didn't love it.  I don't know if I'd bother buying it for myself, but the free sample was certainly nice while it lasted."}
