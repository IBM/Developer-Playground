On the up side, they're only 100 calories per can, and it didn't have that metallic taste that sometimes permeates canned coffee drinks.  It wasn't overly sweet, but seemed to lack a strong coffee punch.  Also, it tasted watered down compared to other drinks I've had, and that was the biggest negative.  I did like it, but just wanted something with more to it rather than feeling like each sip was only giving me half the flavor."}
