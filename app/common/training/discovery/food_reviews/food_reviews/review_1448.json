(The can has a warning NOT to do so.)  I really wanted to make sure that the coffee, milk and chocolate were well blended - the way I do with the cold coffee beverages from the \"S\" company.  But I held off.<br /><br />2)  The flavor was OK.  Too much chocolate for being labeled a cappuccino - but not bad.  And not quite as weirdly viscous as other coffee/milk drinks.<br /><br />3)  The can is too thin to stay safely in my car's drink holder.<br /><br />So...I would drink this again if offered - but it might not be my first choice."}
