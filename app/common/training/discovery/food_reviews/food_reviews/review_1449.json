I usually drink coffee with half and half and no sugar, so this can was a bit sweet for my taste and a bit thin in texture. I added ice and a splash of half and half to a tall glass and it was okay. The coffee flavor was good and the hint of cocoa could be tasted, however there was a bit of a metallic taste from the can. I liked it better than Starbucks coffee, which usually has a burnt taste to me. My favorite coffee always was Dunkin Donuts, but even that has changed over the years, (or maybe my taste has change). I gave this three stars for the coffee flavor but not the five stars because it was too sweet. It's okay for a quick fix."}
