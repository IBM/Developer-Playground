I recently tried Lara Bar for the first time, and have tried several flavors now. Who knew an energy/meal bar could be this good? Simply amazing!<br /><br />My favorite is the PECAN PIE FLAVOR. It satisfies my craving for an actual pecan pie, and it only has 3 ingredients! The ingredients are: dates, pecans, almonds. That's it! I cannot figure out how they make it taste like pie with only these ingredients but they do. How wonderful to have an item with such a short healthy ingredient list.<br /><br />My second favorite so far is the Lemon Bar, it's really good too, and has only 5 ingredients. Key Lime Pie is good... heck, they're all good!<br /><br />So refreshing to eat something that tastes so decadent, and is made from whole foods, thanks Lara Bar! :-)"}
