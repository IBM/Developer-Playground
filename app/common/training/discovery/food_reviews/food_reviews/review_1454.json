Then tried some of the fruit ones. Some were great. I didn't love the cherry as much. I tried this one because I love ginger.  I don't love the flavor of this bar as much as other Larabars.  With all the bars Larabar offers, I probably won't buy ginger snap again. I will definitely stick with Larabar, though. Tasty without the sugars."}
