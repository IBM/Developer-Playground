I don't get breaks or lunches, so I eat one mid-shift which holds me over well until I get home to eat a real meal.  They're convenient to throw in my purse, and are easy to eat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super healthy.  Three simple ingredients, no fillers, no added sugars.<br />- Good source of protein, plus a handful of vitamins and minerals.<br />- Very tasty.  Slightly sweet, and fresh peanut taste.<br />- Soft and chewy, easy to eat.  The peanuts are ground into small pieces, which I really like.  They're plentiful and blended perfectly with the dates.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Make me thirsty.  I recommend at least a little water after eating.<br />- A bit pricey.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I just love these Larabars.  They don't taste just like a peanut butter cookie, but they do have a wonderful flavor which I found surprising given the ingredients.  I love that there is no added sugars.  One bar makes me feel great after I eat it, and there is no sugar crash later on.  With protein and fiber, it's a great choice.  Also, it's gluten-free and dairy-free for individuals who cannot consume either of those two things.<br /><br />I highly recommend!"}
