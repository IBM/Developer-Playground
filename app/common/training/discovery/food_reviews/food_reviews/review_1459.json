They were good -- so good that I put on more pounds than I wanted because I enjoyed them so. But it's hard to find that spicy ginger taste that satisfies. Most gingerbreads and gingersnaps are lacking.<br /><br />In February, I started eating paleo. (Look it up - I won't explain it here.) For the occasional \"cheat,\" I wanted something naturally sweetened without glutens or grains. Many paleo/primal websites recommend Larabars. I've eaten them before but never the Ginger Snap variety.<br /><br />O.M.G. They hit the spot and then some. What an indulgence -- and they remind me of my fattening gingerbread men from Christmas. Soft and chewy with that marvelous gingerbread taste. So worth it.<br /><br />So whether you're eating paleo, gluten free, natural whole foods or just want a good for you treat, Ginger Snap is it for ginger lovers."}
