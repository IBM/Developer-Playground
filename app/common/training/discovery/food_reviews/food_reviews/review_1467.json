I'm so happy I can purchase larabars off Amazon, because I live in Canada and honestly, they sell them for about $1.75/bar it's ridiculous.<br /><br />The lemon larabars are so far my favorite. They are healthy too, with no preservatives and have such little ingredients and are all natural! They're such a great snack. I would HIGHLY recommend the lemon larabars!"}
