I feed them to my 1 and 3 year olds for a night time snack or an on the go 'get by until supper' snack.<br /><br />They love many of the flavors, but banana and peanut butter & jelly are their favorites (well...according to my 3 year old...b/c 1 year old can't talk and eats everything!).  My favorites are banana and lemon.<br /><br />I use them as part of my diet routine.  I keep one with me at all times so that I never get tempted to hit a drive thru.<br /><br />These bars are not exactly a Ho-Ho or Twinkie, but they do taste great and are a good manageable healthy treat to your day!!<br /><br />I tell everyone about them!  Their limited ingredients make me feel good about giving them to my kids!"}
