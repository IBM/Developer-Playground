The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste.  What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.<br /><br />These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love.  However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like)."}
