Normally I like the chocolate coconut combination, but in this brand it just didn't work for me!  If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!"}
