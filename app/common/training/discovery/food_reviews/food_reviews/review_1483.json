Grinberg","HelpfulnessNumerator":1,"HelpfulnessDenominator":1,"Score":5,"date":"2009-08-06","Summary":"Good product, stale inventory, great customer service","text":"The box shipped to me receives one star for old and stale inventory.<br />The product itself receives 5 stars.<br />Amazon receives 5 stars for refunding the full purchase amount.<br />Customer Service receives 5 starts for their professional conduct.<br /><br />For several years I have been purchasing my favorite LaraBar flavors at the nearest Trader Joe's location. I recently moved to an area where TJ has little presence, if any, and ordered the bars from Amazon instead. Although the label on the box had indicated the expiration date was 10 months away, the first bar I chewed into was dry, stale, with a bitter after taste. This is disappointing because I am familiar with this product and I know what flavor to expect. I still like LaraBar and will continue to consume it but my next purchase will have to be from a brick and mortar location where I can sample an individual bar prior to purchasing a full box.<br />Upon my request Amazon had issued a full refund for this purchase. Hail Amazon!!!!"}
