They taste just like the flavor they're supposed to and aren't too sweet for a quick snack. They still hold you over until you can get some actual food in your stomach, which is great. I keep these around as much as I can! My favorite GF flavors are key lime pie, pecan pie, apple pie, and banana nut bread."}
