Could the nuts be chopped a bit smaller? Sure. But then the whole bar would be too mushy. Could they use fewer dates (to cut the sugar) and make the bar as moist? Doubtful. Cheries are tough as dried fruit goes, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the excessive dates. (Note, though, I can't stand plain dates and I don't notice the flavor or find them overwhelming. I'd just like a more tart, less sweet bar.)<br />This is the alternative to giving yourself and your family dried fruit--this bar is softer, easier to share, and slightly more flavorful than the best dried fruit. It makes nuts palatable to kids who think they don't like nuts. And that means more protein into your diet (though not as much as I'd like, it has exponentially more than plain fruit).<br />Great bar. Good price through Amazon. Stash these bars in your car, your briefcase, your desk drawer, your diaper bag, your kids' backpacks, and your family's workout bags."}
