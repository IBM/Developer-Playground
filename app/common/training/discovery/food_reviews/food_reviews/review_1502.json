Very peppery. Good potato flavor. Cruchy, but not mouth-injuringly so (you know how some brands of chips can be). Plus if you are extremely fastidious, you will undoubtedly enjoy the uniformity of size and shape that these chips have.<br /><br />Like Pr*ngl*s they are made from potato starch rather than actual sliced potatoes, but unlike those and other similar brands, they do not leave me feeling like I ate spoonfuls of vegetable shortening after consuming half a bag.<br /><br />The only other flavor of Popchips that I like are the plain original flavor. The other ones have poorly constructed flavor profiles in my considered opinion. Sometimes if you want to go lowfat, you really need to go simple with the seasoning, and it doesn't get much simpler than salt and pepper."}
