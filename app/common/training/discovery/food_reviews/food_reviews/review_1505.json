I thought these were going to taste like dry, boring, bland chip replacements. Imagine my surprise halfway through the first bite. It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor, but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack, a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and something to share with the children in my life. After one bag, you might not want to share."}
