You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.  However, this treat in my opinion is worth your money, as so many other healthy treats are expensive and taste not so great.  I hope you will enjoy them I do and my family does too."}
