I will never again, and I repeat, NEVER, buy another baked chip again. These are by far, the best \"healthy\" chip in the biz! Parmesan Garlic has got to be the best flavor, but sour cream n onion come in at a close second. I order these, box after box, and have never been disappointed. If you are on the fence about whether to try them, go for it!"}
