I can snack on this or even replace lunch with some of them. There is just the right amount of salt and, despite being produced very unlike traditional chips, the expected crunch is still present. The only complaint I have is that the material of the chip is actually fairly coarse and if you're eating them quickly, I find the roof of my mouth gets a little raw."}
