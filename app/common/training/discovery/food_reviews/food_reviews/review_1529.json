You know those chips Munchos that you get at convenience stores?  Well, these kind of remind me of them but they are: 1) tastier, 2) less salty, 3) less processed tasting and 4) better for you.  These are great snacking chips, good with dip, but definitely great on their own.  Crunchy and delicious!  If you like potato chips, you will definitely like Popchips.  Only thing that is weird is that some of the bags are saltier than others - I am not sure why."}
