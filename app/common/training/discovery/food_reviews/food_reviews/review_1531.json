The original flavor and texture kind of reminded me of Munchos. The barbecue is good too, very sweet, like KC Masterpiece. And the sour cream and chives is pretty good as well. If I was looking for a quick \"salty\" fix, I would definitely go with the original. They are very light and airy, different!"}
