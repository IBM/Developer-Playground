What's in them is as good as what's not in them.<br />No preservatives. No artificial flavors. No saturated fat. No gluten ingredients.<br />Popchips are thicker than ordinary chips. They're crunchy,zesty, tasty, and not overly salty. I like that there's no greasy residue on my hands after eating some.<br /><br />The chips are uniform in size, strong enough to dip, and small enough to make double dipping unnecessary.<br />After sampling these for the first time, I'm looking forward to enjoying these great tasting and satisfying chips again."}
