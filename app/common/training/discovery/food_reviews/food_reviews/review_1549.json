I am not sure I would've tried them otherwise, but I am glad I did and now I'm addicted. I am a thin person so it's all about the taste for me, calories are not an issue. I've never really liked the taste of greasy chips, but baked chips seemed so bland. These chips are the best  and you should give them a try. They are tasty and not greasy. My personal favorite is the original potato flavor, but they are all pretty good.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I don't normally review food products but these were so good I wanted to share."}
