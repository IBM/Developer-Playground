The packing/shipping however leaves a lot to be desired.  My box came completely smashed up and all the bags are crushed, with only about 1/4 of the chips in each bag actually intact. The rest are crumbs and dust.  VERY disappointed in the packaging.  There should be a box within a box and some type of protection..ie packing peanuts."}
