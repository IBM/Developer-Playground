The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy. The calories and fat are very low. No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip. You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem. But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the \"popping,\" but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!"}
