I loved the sour cream and onion, original, and salt and vinegar. Was not a fan of the bbq (kind of bitter), salt and pepper (too peppery), and the cheddar (not a fan of cheddar flavored stuff). I would definitely buy the sour cream and onion and original flavored ones again! So crispy and crunchy and great chip-like flavor. They remind me of regular pringles but with more crunch and flavor!"}
