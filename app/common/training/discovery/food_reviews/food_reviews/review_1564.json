And your significant other will remind you of this the next day. lol...But not hydro oils or fructose corn syrup or other stuff that should no longer be in any of our snacks are NOT in these. I have replaced the regular potato chips,\"even the baked ones\" with these. I think they're better. Going to try the sea salted vinegar ones as well as the plains. Will report following. (Id give these a 4.5 if I could)<br /> ***One other thing to note;if you have soft skin in your mouth these may scratch it up."}
