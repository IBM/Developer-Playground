They were so good I bought several extra bags and brought them home with me for my kids to try (9 and 10 year olds).  They liked them so much, I ordered a 24 pack online so they could have one in their lunch each day.  My kids shared these chips with their friends at lunch and told me that everyone loved them!  All their friends wanted to know where we got them from!"}
