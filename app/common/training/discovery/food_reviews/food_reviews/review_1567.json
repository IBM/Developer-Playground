They all they good, the BBQ is the most flavorful. The salt and vinegar is a bit off, and it kind of has that \"hmm this taste like health food\". Which the BBQ doesn't have that effect at all. Though I'm still happy with my purchase. I have always been a fan of Popchips and always recommend my friends and family to eat this instead of their fried trans fatty chips."}
