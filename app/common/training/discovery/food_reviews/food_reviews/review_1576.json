This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises, but still skeptical since people's taste buds aren't the same. Once I received it, tried a bag and these are great. They aren't greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor. I rather eat these whenever I feel like I need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that's a bit greasy.<br /><br />Either way, these are great. Go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you. Buy a bag to try out and if you love it, just keep getting more from your retail store or buy 'em cheaper here on Amazon!"}
