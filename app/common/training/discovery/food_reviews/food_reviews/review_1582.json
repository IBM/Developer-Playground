I had to take a lot of medication and continue to since an automobile accident.  One of my medications really did a number on my stomach lining which in turn creates a lot of acid reflux on a normal day to day basis.  So I thought giving alkaline a try couldn't hurt.  And it most certainly did not hurt.  It was nice not to have to take meds before and after meals. I was down to just one acid reflux pill a day.  Normally I end up taking one a hour before every meal and possibly one or two after meals.  I just took one in the evening and that was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />I would certainly buy this again.  Other members of my family liked the texture of the water too.  I sort of wish we could get in our five gallon jugs for the water cooler."}
