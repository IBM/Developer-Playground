It's bottled water. There are some basics to consider. How does it taste, well, like water. Clean, crisp, refreshing, water. Essentia does that very well, no faults at all. The bottle has a description on it as \"A difference you can taste.\" This  can be true, but I've been drinking different bottled waters over the years and I must say there is a smoothness that I do notice. It kind of reminds me of my youth in summer camp in the Pocono Mountains of PA. There was a stream that was fed by a rubber pipe in the ground. This has that heavy smooth cold taste that I always remembered. Nothing before, has reminded me of that experience. Am I imagining it, I don't think so. It really is different.<br /><br />I like the water very much. I was only given one bottle to evaluate. I can't talk to any long term benefits of the pH or electrolytes that are in the water. It's very good water and I'll leave it to you if the price is worth it to you. Cheers!"}
