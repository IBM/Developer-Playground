Those units can be very expensive, so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia's 9.5 pH water may be a good option. It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes, though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits. Since it comes in a plastic bottle you'll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn't make the water absorb plastic chemicals. If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option, though to be more eco-conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics."}
