The forest service recommended bringing at least 32 ounces per person. This bottle of Essentia looked like a good way for us to bring the recommended amount, and yet still have some left over. Needless to say, after climbing over 1000 ft in a mile and a half, we found ourselves glad we had this product. It touts having lots of essential vitamins, etc to help you with such situations. I'm not sure if it really made that big of a difference compared to regular drinking water. It certainly tastes about like regular water, so nothing really bad to say about the taste of the product. In our case, it was water (whether enhanced or not), and it helped us achieve our goal of visiting the cave and having the water we needed. It certainly served its purpose. The question begs, though, would our experience have been any different had we just had regular water? The entrance to the cave even had natural spring water you could fill your containers with.<br /><br />I'm one who certainly gets daily headaches if I do not drink enough water. I've personally found drinking things like Gatorade or Propel certainly help me more than just drinking water. I suspect Essentia is going to be similar, despite its taste being basically water. It probably fools the mind more, compared to having some sort of flavor enhanced water/drink.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably. The pricing isn't bad for a 12 pack, and you certainly get a good size bottle for each of the 12 units."}
