A good PUR, Brita or Zero Water filter should be enough. So no one actually needs to PURCHASE Essentia. That said, if you're on a long car ride or visiting another country, bottled water makes sense. Essentia is a high pH water (on the base side. Low would be acidic and you wouldn't want to drink it). It tastes...okay. I've have better and I've had worse. It's a little pricer than most bottled water, but I'm happy that it is Electrolyte infused and that the bottles are BPA and Phthalate free. That makes Essentia a better choice than Aquavita or even Fiji which has a massively high carbon footprint.<br /><br />All in all, it's water. I can't say I'd go out of my way for this as I'd prefer to get Smartwater for my electrolyte enchanced h20 (better tasting), but I'd pick this up over a lot of the more common mass produced, secretly just tap water brands."}
