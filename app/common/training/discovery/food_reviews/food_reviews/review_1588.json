In that sense I like it more: I can't stand the slightly bitter/metallic taste of those waters.  This one \"tastes\" more like water.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is advertised for having the \"correct\" pH level, and as being electrolyte infused, but I have noticed nothing special about it in terms of how it impacts my workouts: it's wet, just like any other water.  So in this facet, I rate it as being less than advertised."}
