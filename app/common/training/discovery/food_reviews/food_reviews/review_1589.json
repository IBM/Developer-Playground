I'm not sure that these waters make any different in health or mood but if you do then just buy the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AP7NV\">Brita 42629 Slim Pitcher</a> and save yourself money in the long run plus save all that plastic from the landfills. The water itself had no taste, was clear and did seem to make my tea taste better but again so will a Brita filter and it's much better for the environment."}
