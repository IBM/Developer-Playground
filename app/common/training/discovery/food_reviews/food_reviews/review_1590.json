Nothing special in taste. At least I couldn't find any flavor. Which I like. I don't like the taste of arrowhead water. I prefer drinking Dasani water. Can't compare to this water due to the pH. Didn't notice any benefits of drinking water. Pretty sure if I had continued drinking the water overtime there would be some sort of advantage over regular water. As far as price I will stick to the regular water that is less expensive."}
