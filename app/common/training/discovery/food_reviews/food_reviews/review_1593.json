I grew up on tap water, unfiltered, straight from the hose or sink, and didn't mind it at all.  As I grew older I wanted the mineral taste to the water that you find in tap water, and spring water just seemed so bland and boring that the only time I ever actually liked drinking it was when I had run a marathon and was exhausted and any water would do.  Even now I bring bottled water to work, quickly finish it, and then drink tap water for the rest of the day.  I don't understand why people bring gallons of bottled water to work or the gym, or bring 4 16 oz. bottled water with them.  Made no sense.<br /><br />With Essentia I think I may have been turned.  Maybe it is the pH balance, but whatever they did to the water I absolutely love.  Crisp and fresh tasting, more so than normal bottled water.  I can see myself purchasing this and keeping it stocked.  They do come in rather large size bottles.  The one I had was 1.5 liters, but you receive 12 of them for around $28, which comes to a comparison shop of a little under a $1 per 16 oz. bottle.  From someone who doesn't like bottled water, I did enjoy this one quite a bit.<br /><br />5 stars."}
