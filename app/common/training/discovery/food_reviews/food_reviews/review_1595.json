After getting a bottle at Whole Foods, I knew this is the water I like and I immediately ordered a whole case of it.  The taste is awesome, does make you feel more hydrated upon drinking (electrolytes), and the very high pH level aids in bodily functions such as digestion.  My body loves it.  I've tried many artisan (aka= pricier) waters out there available on the market and this water now made its way to my groceries list.  The 3 waters I now drink everyday are Fiji (it has high silica content, which is great for the skin), Hawaiian Springs (an all-rounded good water, and the bottle is pretty so I drink it when I go out), and now Essentia.  I also suggest people to really look into the pH level of the waters they are buying; don't bother if it's lower than 7 because it won't really benefit your body much (you'll be amazed at how many of the pricier waters are below pH 7; and surprisingly, Whole Foods 365 water is a nice water that is price-friendly)."}
