It is silky smooth and rests well on my palate.  Sometimes these bottled waters, especially those with ulterior motives, can have an almost thick texture, but Essentia goes down with ease.  Now, this water is infused with electrolytes and is formatted to help reduce acid reflux and help with indigestion.  I must admit that this works rather well in that regard.  I've had an issue with indigestion for a while (years) and while I can't say that this has cured me entirely, I have noticed a difference in the way I feel.  I'm glad that some have compared this to Evian, because Evian is one brand of water I cannot stomach (talking of thick water), but Essentia is clean and smooth and serves its purpose beautifully."}
