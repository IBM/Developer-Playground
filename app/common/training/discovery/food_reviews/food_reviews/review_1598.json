Unlike most bottled water, Essentia doesn't have any minerals or other elements that will give you a strange taste.  Just clean water and nothing else.  Another thing that I enjoyed about the product is the plastic bottle, it's not too big but it has just enough water to do the job.<br /><br />So, if you are into bottled water or enjoy the flavor of distilled then look no further than Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water.  Just water and nothing else."}
