I rarely drink bottled water, but when I do I often find the taste doesn't impress me much. Water is wet, tasteless, hydrating, that's it.<br /><br />I can say, as far as water goes, this Essentia water had zero funny, minerally, chemically taste to it. Pure and tasteless. I did appreciate that. I can't speak to the added pH factor because I'm not really sure what the benefits of that would look like in real time. I suppose if I only drank this water for a month through all the cycling, running and swimming I do I might see a difference, but that is a costly experiment for someone on a budget.<br /><br />All in all, decent bottled water, but nothing supernatural about it that would make me switch from tap."}
