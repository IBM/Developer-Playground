Give me a Camelback bottle and an hour in the refrigerator and I'll gladly drink our city water as is.  When I got the chance to try Essentia's purified, pH balanced water for review purposes, I jumped at it, mostly to find out what I was missing.  On balance, I like it better that tap water or some of the store bottled waters.  I'm probably too stingy to buy more myself, but if you think it would make the difference between drinking water and going without, I would highly recommend Essentia.<br /><br />Flavor:  Essentia is osmotically purified, then electrolytes* are added to mimic the subtle mineral flavors that you get with groundwater.  The result: A very clean water flavor, with an almost silky feel as you drink it.  The difference isn't huge -- it's all water, after all -- but it's definitely there, and it's definitely an improvement.<br /><br />pH Balance: As stated, this is pH balanced at 9.5.  I have to confess I haven't read anything on why you might want water this alkaline, and I didn't notice any difference while drinking it.  Still, if you're looking for an alkaline drink, this fits the bill."}
