I don't like super cold water and most taste awful at room temperature so that is the temperature I judge water by. At room temp this water tasted great and I felt hydrated after drinking it which is the most important thing. I used reverse osmosis water before and no matter how much I drank I would still get dehydrated because of the 0 mineral content your body just doesn't hydrate. This water left me feeling great even after a very strenuous workout I didn't feel like I had to keep going for more and more water. This water has good mineral content and hydrates well and tastes really great what more can you ask for."}
