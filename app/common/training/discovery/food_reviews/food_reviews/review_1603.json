Now I only had one bottle with me on the 20 mile hike so my experience is limited and the weather was perfect for hiking (i.e. not hot but very warm)<br /><br />The following is from the product page:<br /><br />\"Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.\"<br />- The perfect water has no taste and this had a slight bitter taste<br /><br />\"Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.\"<br />- On the trail, this water lasted a long time.  Therefore, I must assume that the hydration claim is valid<br /><br />\"Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.\"<br />-This of course is virtually impossible to evaluate<br /><br />\"It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more.\"<br />-Again, this is virtually impossible to evaluate.<br /><br />I would guess that if you are just looking for drinking water, this is a waste of money but if you are looking for water to drink while exercising or other physical activity where hydration is very important this might be worth looking into."}
