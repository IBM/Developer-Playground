Just what I needed after running. After trying it, I guess i will stick to Gatorade to replenish electrolytes.<br /><br />I tried this water over several days and I have to say,  have never felt so thirsty whilst drinking so called \"water\". Let's start with the taste. I have tried spring water, as in 'put my hand in a spring and drink water' spring water and this can't taste any further from it. It tastes metallic and artificial at the same time. It leaves my mouth  with a horrible after taste. Not only that, after drinking it I was never dated. I have never been so thirsty after drinking water... Ever.<br /><br />The price of this is well above anything I would pay for water. At least <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NPUTSq\">Vitamin Water</a> tasted good."}
