So it was time to make change.  Usually I just drink from the filter I attached to my kitchen faucet since bottled water is not good for the environment and sometimes bottled water manufacturers have been found to just put tap water in their bottles.  Essentia hypes \"silky smooth taste\" \"hydrates better\" \"electrolytes infused\" and \"Best available pH at 9.5\".  Okay, the last two sound like marketing mumbo jumbo.  It does have silky smooth taste, but really all water I have drank aside from unfiltered well or city water has silky smooth taste.  It does have a slight weird taste to it.  Not bad weird or good weird, just different taste to what I am used to.  As for its claim to that it hydrated better, I drank it after mowing the lawn and did not feel better than I do with my regular filtered water.  Essentia will not get me to change from tap water, but if you only drink bottled water you may want to give it a try, it is a bigger bottle which makes it slightly better for the environment than the smaller bottles (but not s good as just buying a filter)."}
