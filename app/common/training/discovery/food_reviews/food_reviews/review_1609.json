And I say this from a bottled-water drinker perspective. Water in my part of the country is specially hard, even when applying consumer filtration. That is why we have regular drinking water delivery. But after trying Essentia, I have a brand new perspective of what drinking water should be. Nothing beats water that has been industrially treated with the right minerals and ph balance. Unlike other consumer grade bottled drinking water, the Essentia undergoes the usual filtration: reverse osmosis, UV, etc. but what makes this a truly long lasting hydrating liquid is that it is infused with electrolytes and life essential minerals that you cannot get with consumer-grade bottled water. Essentia hydrates better making drinking water fun and far in between. Very highly recommended!!"}
