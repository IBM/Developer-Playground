A google search can be hard to find a good source given the amount of salesmanship surrounding this type of product.  However, I felt the livestrong website had a well-sourced write up ([...]).  Having only had one bottle to sample, the long term benefits are not my concern for the purposes of this review.<br /><br />What I did notice right away was that this water does actually have a unique taste -- as subtle as water tastes can be.  I thought it was actually quite pleasant and clean -- certainly better than the filtered tap water that comes out of my fridge.  The electrolytes, which can sometimes have an oily taste, are undetectable.<br /><br />The hydration factor is noticeable to me.  I would go out on a limb and say that it may even surpass the hydration factor of electrolyte water on its own (which can be made easily by buying electrolyte packs to add to water).<br /><br />Now, is the hydration factor and *potential* long term health benefit something that's worth more than double the price of, say, Poland Spring?  That's up to you.  There's not a lot of information surrounding how much of this stuff you'd need to drink to see health benefits.  So using it as a long term product might get quite expensive.  Using it for hydration after a long day, or when feeling sick would be my choice."}
