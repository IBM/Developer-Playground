I have a reverse osmosis system under my kitchen sink, so I know how good, clean water should taste and this Essentia definitely tastes pure. I can say that I did feel better hydrated first thing in the morning drinking this instead of my water.<br /><br />It tastes MUCH better than the majority of bottled waters out there that are little more than tap water. This is a thousand times better tasting than tap water. Essentia has no smell and no aftertaste. I will be using this before my morning workouts from now on."}
