Water is my drink of choice.<br /><br />This Essentia pH balanced water has an advantage over plain water when it comes to refreshment. I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.<br /><br />Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out. In every bit of honesty, I savored this bottle of water. I chugged, at a reasonable pace, every drop. I found it delicious, smooth and refreshing.<br /><br />Sure, it's more than just water; actually, it's purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide. Like most commercial beverages, this one has a formula as well, and it works out great.<br /><br />In the end, it's still water, but there is something favorable about water with a pH of 9.5. When chilled, this stuff is remarkably enjoyable. If you're a water connoisseur and you buy bottled water anyway, then definitely try Essentia - it's very nice."}
