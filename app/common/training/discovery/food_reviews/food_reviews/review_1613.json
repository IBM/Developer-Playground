I drink a lot of bottled water, and I'm very particular when it comes to taste.  This brand tastes better than most.  It ranks right up there with popular French brands when it comes to flavor.  I also enjoy that I can get a good electrolyte drink without calories or sugary taste.  There are times when I just don't want a sugary drink but I do need the added benefit of an electrolyte boost.  I'll try this brand again."}
