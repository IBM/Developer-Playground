When I see these sorts of claims, I get very suspicious.  I'm not a scientist, but these sorts of claims bother me when no studies are cited.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the 9.5 pH level is achieved by the addition of sodium bicarbonate, the same ingredient in many antacids.  If you really hate the taste of antacids, trying this water to get relief might be worth it.<br /><br />I have to admit that this water really does taste great.  It's difficult to describe the taste exactly, but it tastes much better than most bottled waters.<br /><br />For some odd reason, this water gave me a stomach ache, so despite the taste, I won't give it another try.<br /><br />I marginally recommend this item if you want to give it a try for relieving indigestion."}
