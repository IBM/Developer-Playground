Choosing instead to use Gatorade or the Mio water flavoring is neither ideal or inexpensive in the long run either. I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find the Essentia pH Drinking water a nice alternative to flavorings plus the bottle that was supplied by Amazon was much larger than I expected. At the current price point this offers very good value for money especially when compared to the little 8oz bottles you can get at the store.<br /><br />Now I can't comment on the additional positives added by the pH levels boasted on the bottle, nor can I honestly say whether this water tastes 'good' compared to others. It tastes like clean water. I can say that some of the pills I take (steroids) taste awful so it's nice to be able to down them with a cold refreshing bit of aqua instead of brown sludge or sickly sweet drinks.<br /><br />Ultimately, if like me, your water supply is less than stellar then you can't go wrong with this brand for cost or quantity."}
