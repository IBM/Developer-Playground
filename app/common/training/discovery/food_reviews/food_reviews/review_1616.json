I can not say I felt any different after drinking this, it has all kinds of wonderful praise sung on its page like: \"Silky smooth taste; Hydrates better; Electrolyte infused; Best available pH at 9.5<br />Convenient and portable in BPA and Phthalate free recyclable bottle\" I think that THIS is what I liked best about this product, the bottle. If you are going to purchase bottled water it's a GOOD thing that the bottle is BPA and Phthalate free plus recyclable. I drank some of the water plain, tasted like regular water to me, and made a pot of coffee with most of it, it DID make a GOOD pot of coffee!"}
