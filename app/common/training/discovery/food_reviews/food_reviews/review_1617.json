My tap water is terrible and this is some of the best tasting water I have had.  I am already a regular drinker of PH water but it is  8.4 and this particular one is 9.5.  I have found that PH water really does give me more energy and I have found that it allows me to eat some foods I love that I used to have more problems with because of the acid, like  tomatoes and uncooked apples.<br />I know this water  is man made but they do the job right with reverse osmosis.  I  love the extra things added to this water because many of us need them so much in our busy lives, things like electrolytes and potassium. I will buy this water as an extra when I am out and about or when I run out of water but I am sticking with my 8.4 alkaline water because it is cheaper, has the same smooth, good  taste and is natural as well as less expensive than this one."}
