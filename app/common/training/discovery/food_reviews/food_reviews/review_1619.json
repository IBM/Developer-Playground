I couldn't.  It tastes like water, refreshing when cold.  After drinking it for a few days, I didn't notice any significant difference in my biological functions.  Perhaps drinking nothing but pH adjusted water for weeks would make a difference.  It didn't do much for me.<br /><br />In short, it's decent bottled water.  If you like still bottled water in plastic bottles, then you probably would enjoy this as much as any other."}
