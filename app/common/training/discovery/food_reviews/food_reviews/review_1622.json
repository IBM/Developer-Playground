It doesn't really taste any different than regular water (which is OK with me, because I LOVE water). As far as reducing reflux or helping with digestion, I can't really speak to that as I was only sent one bottle for review. It's certainly something I would try, as it SEEMS to have more benefits than other bottled water."}
