That being said I find myself pretty much unmoved by Essentia's claim for a 9.5PH factor, electrolyte infused & great taste.<br /><br />Quite frankly it tastes like filtered water. Unoffensive & yes, thirst quenching. I suppose the real bone to pick here would be the price. A case of this = twelve 1.5L bottles runs between $22.00 to $68.00 bucks. A case of 24, 20ox bottles runs for about $31.00 - meanwhile a case of Aquafina: 32/16.9oz bottles can go for as low as $4.95. And tastes pretty much the same.<br /><br />So I suppose the real answer is not so much the water itself but how much you are willing to pay?"}
