I drank the entire bottle in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />I take other pre-workout and post-workout supplements and many of them have potassium and electrolytes.  I noticed that a bottle of water from Wal-mart, bottled at a municipal plan, contains the same level of potassium as Essentia.  I down a couple of 16.9 ounce bottles of that water after running as well.<br /><br />So, I can't attest that this water will change your life.  I can't even attest that it's worth more than other waters.  pH balanced water sounds great, and there's really nothing from a taste level that's bad, certainly.  But did it impact my overall physical recovery after a run?  I don't think so.  I was less thirsty, of course, but my legs didn't spring into action any faster or anything like that.<br /><br />It's good water.  Given a choice of this water or another brand that was similarly priced, I'd reach for this one.  But I also didn't experience a compelling reason to switch from the cheaper Wal-mart water."}
