While a lot of athletes get their electrolytes from Gatorade, this water would be perfect if you don't care for the Gatorade sweetened flavors.  This water tasted great and has no lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />There are no calories, and the pH level is 9.5.  The water is bottled in the state of Washington.<br /><br />Unfortunately the one negative is that the price is high for bottled water."}
