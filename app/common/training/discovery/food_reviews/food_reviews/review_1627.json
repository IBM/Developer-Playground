All of the waters were at room temperature. Not surprisingly, the tap water tasted the worst.  The bottled water was next, and I would say that this water tied with the Brita filter water for good taste.  The Essentia water tasted \"softer\" (similar to Evian), but with a better flavor. It has a little after-taste which I presume is related to the minerals.  I can't evaluate any health benefits because I've only tried the product for a few days, but I'll update this review if I notice anything.  Bottom line-- at home I'll still probably use Brita-filtered water because it's less expensive, but when buying water at the store or needing bottled water for any reason, this is an excellent choice and better-tasting than typical bottled water."}
