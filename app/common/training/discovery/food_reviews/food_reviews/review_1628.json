I've only tried one bottle so far, so I can't speak to its long-term health benefits.<br /><br />I DO know that UV treated reverse-osmosis water is the \"safest,\" although, as with distillation, the R-O process also depletes minerals.  Which is probably why Essentia has added electrolytes, a big plus.  My hubby has a health condition that demands he carefully monitor his electrolyte levels, so this water makes that just a little bit easier, with a good balance of magnesium, sodium, and potassium, without any of the added sugars of conventional sports drinks like Gatorade.<br /><br />If you take vitamin supplements like I do, it's especially important to use a chlorine-free water like this for mixing and simply taking your supplements.  Chlorine SERIOUSLY interferes with the efficacy of supplements; this is especially obvious with green drinks, which will actually lose some of their color (and TONS of their nutritional value).
