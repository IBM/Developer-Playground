I'm not a big fan of sports drinks so this unflavored option is welcome. If there's anything I can say that I don't like, it'd be that the water feels \"heavy\". I generally drink a generic bottled spring water (the tap water is very hard and tastes off to me) and in comparison the Essentia felt almost thick on the tongue.<br /><br />For the green folks, the bottle itself is listed as BPA free (PET 1) but it is not biodegradable (but it will not leech into the soil either - it simply won't breakdown).<br /><br />The purification method the company lists on their website is microfiltration, UV sterilization and reverse osmosis. For those who aren't familiar with these processes, safe to say that it really will not matter where the original water source originates from if these processes are used. Both microfiltration and reverse osmosis will remove most of the large particles and the UV light will kill off the organisms. Using a spring water source would really be irrelevant at this point because you'd essentially be stripping everything out of the water, leaving nothing but simple H2O.<br /><br />All-in-all, the Essentia didn't taste bad, and the flavorless electrolyte source is a great option if you're not a sports drink fan. Also, the fact that it didn't taste \"salty\" like the Disani-type waters was a big plus for me."}
