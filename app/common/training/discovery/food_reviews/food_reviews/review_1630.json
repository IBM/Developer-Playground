Before you think negatively of that, consider that they then put it through the reverse osmosis process and add the ingredients that I mention in the video.<br /><br />More importantly, since it's bottled in Bothell, Washington, you can be assured that their municipal water is outstanding - practically spring water.<br /><br />The fact that it tastes just like nice water isn't surprising. It would be worrisome if it didn't taste like water!"}
