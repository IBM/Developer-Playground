The largest \"Travel Mug\" setting leaves the coffee too weak and the smallest \"coffee cup\" setting is too much and even the middle size isn't \"just right\" and sort of tastes like a \"lite\" cappaccino. I never thought I was hard to please but it seems like this has proven me wrong.<br />The price is pretty good so I can't complain on that note, but I guess I'm going to continue to drink this item and let it grow on me. As a now-and-then cup of cappaccino it's ok.<br />The 4 star rating is for the price and convenience of not traveling miles to get a cappaccino."}
