It's an instant powdered mix, which is completely disappointing. I was expecting flavored coffee, not instant mix in a small container. Kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  I guess it's my fault for not having read the package? But no where in the product description does it indicate this is \"Instant Coffee\".<br /><br />I would never buy this product again.  It smells wonderful, but tastes like what it is, and that's simply not good for someone looking for a cup of coffee."}
