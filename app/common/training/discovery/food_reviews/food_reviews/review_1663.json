It has the perfect amount of cream and sugar which is great for me because I have more time to get ready in the morning. Some people say it's gross because it is instant coffee and uses hydrogenated oil but it's super great-- plus you're saving money on cream and sugar! Also, I agree with the person who said it tasted like gas station coffee, but we must have different gas stations because everybody (myself include) loves the cappucinos at my gas station!"}
