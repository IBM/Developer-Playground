It's not great for coffe, but kids would probably love it. I was hoping to actually taste the hazelnut. All you taste is sweetness. It's an overload of the taste buds in all the worst ways. Day one was okay, then progressively it gets worse and worse until now I feel like I have to write a review about it and I don't usually write reviews."}
