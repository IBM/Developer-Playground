It is wonderful to find a K-cup in yummy flavors that is not too acidy on my stomach (like the Emeril Big Bold Easy my husband drinks).<br />This product is difficult to find in stores; our Wal-Mart was constantly running out because it is so popular, so I am happy to find it on Amazon.  This shipment was fast and the price is great.  Thanks!"}
