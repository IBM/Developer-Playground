After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and buy this. The only thing I wish I had done was buy a smaller box. It doesn't taste bad but it isn't so DELISH that I would be running back for more. I am not a real coffee drinker and before Mcdonalds switched over to the stronger mud tasting cap I LOVED theirs so I thought this would taste like it. It is not real sweet (as other reviewers have indicated). I didn't add anything to it but I will have to doctor it up in order to drink all three boxes. I did not taste any aftertaste either. For me it wasn't that bad but it wasn't that GOOD either. It was just ok. I would be willing to try a sample of the French Vanilla. It might taste better."}
