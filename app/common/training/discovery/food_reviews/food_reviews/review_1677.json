I would not recommend their reg coffee, but the hazel nut cappuccino is the best on the market nothing to add just make and enjoy but i recommend not to use more then 6oz.serving size to get the best flavor, using a larger amount will weaken the flavor very important!they also have vanilla cappuccino and carmel cappuccino which are both very good also."}
