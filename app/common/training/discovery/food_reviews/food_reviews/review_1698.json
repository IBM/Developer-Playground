The price was right, so I figured why not.  I prepared a cup & Had to run out, so I took it with me, I took a few sips & it was really yummy. I had to run in for a short meeting & left the cup in the car.  It was a cool day & when I got back to the car, my coffee was cold. I picked it up & took a sip, I was pleasantly surprise at the creamy cold taste, it was fabulous.  So now I drink it cold & hot. Very satisfied with the taste & creamines. So glad I tried it.  Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Sylvia Lorenzano"}
