As I'm writing this (8/24/12) the price of a 24-pack is $34.99 from the cheapest 3rd-party retailer, which is absolutely ridiculous.  AMAZON, why can't you stock the Hawaiian Hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors??  The fact that I would take the time to write a review about this should tell you how much I like the product..."}
