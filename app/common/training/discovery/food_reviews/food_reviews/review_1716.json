It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee."}
