I find it to be a smooth and flavorful dark roast with a lovely aroma, yet without a bitter or acidic quality that might leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  It is a bit expensive, like all k-cups, but I think it's worth it due to convenience and exceptional flavor.  I definitely recommend this coffee to others!"}
