Nice Flavor and a Nice Cup of Coffee.","text":"Wolfgang Puck French Roast is a nice, bold (not too bold), flavorful cup of coffee.  If you like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFSQ6\">Coffee People Extra Bold Organic, Dark Roast Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, then you should like Wolfgang Puck's French Roast.<br /><br />This French Roast has a deep flavor with a hint of sweetness and a smooth finish - a good choice for a morning cup of coffee.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />(Note to Manufacturer: as a consumer, I wish you would use real coffee descriptions(i.e., hints of xxx, smooth finish) rather than fluff advertising like \"Bring the aromas of France home with you and \"Profitez des bons moments\" (enjoy the good moments)!\" - what does that really mean? It took me awhile to decide to purchase this coffee because the description gave me zero idea of what to expect)."}
