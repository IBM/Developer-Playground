Light to Medium Roast. Smooth, Not Acidic.","text":"I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />In this case, with \"Breakfast in Bed\", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered.  \"Breakfast in Bed\" is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild, but not very memorable flavor.  On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.<br /><br />A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC\">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.<br /><br />ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K\">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a><br /><br />ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM\">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing)."}
