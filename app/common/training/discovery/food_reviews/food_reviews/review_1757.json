And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM\">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner."}
