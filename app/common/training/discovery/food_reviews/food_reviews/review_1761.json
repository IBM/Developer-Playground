They have the baked potatoe crisps' texture, but the mini rice cakes' thickness and size. The are healthier than most snack foods, especially in the single serving packs.  My favorite flavors are the BBQ, Cheddar, and Orginal. However, all the varieties are worth a tasty and worth a try.<br /><br />Enjoy!"}
