I have tried most of the flavors and each one is great. When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor."}
