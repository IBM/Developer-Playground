The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!"}
