All the flavors are great, but my favorites are Plain, Cheddar and Sour Cream & Onion.  I started eating them when I was trying to lose weight, and now that I lost the weight, I continue to eat them because the taste so great -- much better than greasy potato chips and more flavorful than baked chips.<br />I love the portion control size. Keep up the great work PopChips!!!!"}
