You would never know they are not fried and they don't have that bland taste like baked chips do. I must say though, this is the only flavor I care for. I bought the multi pack, and I just don't care for the rest. The sea salt and vinegar is downright horrible, the rest are tolerable I guess.BUT, the barbecue ones rock!!"}
