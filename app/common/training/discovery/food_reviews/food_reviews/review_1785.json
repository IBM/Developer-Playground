In my opinion, they BBQ flavoring is really good and these are very crunchy.  It does not taste like these should be healthy for you.  I would rather eat these BBQ chips than any other chips and I love all kinds of chips.  I have now switch over to POPCHIPS as I know I am eating a better chip and its healther too.  For 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat, I feel it is a good choice and the taste makes it worth wild.  I have taken some of these to work and have gotten some co-workers hooked on these as well."}
