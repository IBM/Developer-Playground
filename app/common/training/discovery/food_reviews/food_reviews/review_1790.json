A friend introduced Pop Chips to me and I immediately told her that I hated her because they are so good, they are irrisistable.  I purchased a box of 12 to be delivered every three months so that I can limit myself to one bag per week ... otherwise, I would absolutely be in trouble.<br /><br />Believe me, you have to try these chips!"}
