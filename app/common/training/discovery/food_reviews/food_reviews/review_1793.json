No saturated fat, and no trans fat...Great taste with no guilt.<br /><br />Granted they are not quite as addicting as the Kettle Chips,  but they have a lot less fat.<br /><br />i am concerned that safeway and nobb hill grocery stores are not carrying this product anymore.  i am thinking about ordering a dozen cases and stockpile them up so that i am INSURED of my supply."}
