Ever since I was a child (I'm now 29),I was always a 'salty' tooth.<br /><br />I've gone through Ruffles and every other type of chip.<br /><br />The problem is that no matter if I buy a small or large bag; I'd have to finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />I read about this item in my \"Shape\" magazine for being a low-calorie food and yet being yummy.<br /><br />I tried to find at my local stores but haven't been able to (I live in the Seattle area).<br /><br />Thankfully, I found on Amazon and anxiously awaited my case to come. I was a little nervous to commit to a whole case but was pleasantly surprised when I opened my first bag.<br /><br />I chose this size (0.8-oz over 3-oz) cause I think it's about the right size for a lunch bag.<br /><br />The flavor has a little bit of a kick with it, not too spicy but definitely not a boring bbq flavor.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone who loves chips but can't stop with just one to try a bag of these. They definitely satisfy and don't taste like they're not fried."}
