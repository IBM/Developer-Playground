I don't eat as many of these at 1 sitting as I do with regular (Lay's) BBQ chips.<br />We were buying these at Costco for a short while.  The problem with Costco is that when items become very popular, their bulk cost goes up & Costco moves on to carry something else.  Not even Central Market (TX) carries these!  Thanks goodness for Amazon.  I am signing up for the automatic re-ordering program!"}
