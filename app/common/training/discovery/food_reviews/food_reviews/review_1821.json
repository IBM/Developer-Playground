I love Popchips because they are super-crispy and light. They're air-popped instead of fried or baked and all-natural. You can pronounce all the ingredients on the list. Vegan, kosher, gluten-free, no cholesterol, no saturated fat, no trans-fats, low sodium (220mg or 6% USRDA), no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors, there's nothing in here for me to complain about.<br /><br />1 bag is only 100 calories (30 from fat), which is about 1/3 less than regular potato chips. I could eat the whole thing without feeling guilty. The salt and pepper taste is very pronounced and adds a really nice bite to the chips. When I was done, I found myself running my finger through the inside to pick up the remaining seasoning bits and crumbs.<br /><br />I've tried the BBQ flavor as well as several of the others. This one is my favorite. Highly highly recommended."}
