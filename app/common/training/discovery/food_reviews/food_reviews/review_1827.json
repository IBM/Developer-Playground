Anyway...I get the bag open and I expected them to be gross.  The chips are not gross. They taste like sweet potatos which to me means they need some butter flavor added  to make them taste good.  As it stands, they taste like an unflavored bake potatoe without any butter.<br /><br />I tried to eat a whole bag and they kept getting stuck in my teeth so I gave up.  Also, it just doesn't feel right to be eating sweet potato chips.  I have a whole box of them so I am going to continue to try to get used to them.<br />====<br /><br />Update: I still have a box of these chips left.  I couldn't stomach them, my co-workers said they were too bland, and my friend co-worker said they taste like unflavored cornflakes.<br /><br />I don't see how these will be a hit in stores."}
