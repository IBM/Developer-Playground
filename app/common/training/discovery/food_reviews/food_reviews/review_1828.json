It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you."}
