Then I tasted them. These chips are terrible, there is no parmesan flavor to speak of, and they somehow messed up the garlic as well. Avoid these and the also-no-incuded-assortment flavor of \"jalapeno\". Very disappointed.<br /><br />The cheddar, vinegar & salt and peppered flavors are FANTASTIC!"}
