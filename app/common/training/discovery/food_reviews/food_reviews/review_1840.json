Some people liked it very much, some of them hated it. When i first tried it, they tasted horrible. But somehow I liked it when i had them the next time. Very light, flavored, spicy. The texture on the chips look good, but the after taste is not that great. That was my review. But a couple of my colleagues liked them so much that they had 2 bags of it at once. they loved the taste, flavor and also the after taste. 100 cal per bag with 0 cholesterol, not a bad bet!"}
