It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie \"raisins\" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets"}
