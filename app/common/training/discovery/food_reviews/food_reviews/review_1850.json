I shared the cookie with my kids, and we gobbled up the cookie faster than you can say \"Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookies.\" It was soft (as advertised) and included a sufficient amount of raisins to make me happy (I like raisins). It was soft without being crumbly, moist, and not too dense (some oatmeal cookies are pretty dense). I highly recommend this cookie to anyone thinking of trying it for the first time:)"}
