Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar."}
