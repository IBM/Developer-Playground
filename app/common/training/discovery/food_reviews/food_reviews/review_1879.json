They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something."}
