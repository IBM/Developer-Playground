The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only \"fortifications\" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%)."}
