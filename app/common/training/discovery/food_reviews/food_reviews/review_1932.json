I am purchase Quaker cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the Quaker brand.  I did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like TBHQ and BHT.  For those reasons I will not be purchasing this on a regular basis."}
