Included was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie.  I don't like raisins so I gave most of it to my kiddos.  I did take a taste though and it was delicious.  A lot of store bought oatmeal cookies don't taste good at all but this was so good.  You could see the oats and everything.  What a great special treat to have with whole grains to get that extra fiber we all need.  I can't wait to go and buy some in a different flavor.  :)"}
