This was the first product we tried out of the 5 we were sent to test and it lasted less then ten minutes in my home. My toddler was anxious to give them a try and I have already purchased two more boxes since we tasted the first one. They will definitely be a staple product. I love that they are from a trusted brand and I love that they are made with whole grains and I can feel good about my snack choice!"}
