It is not too big, not too small and the buttons are just right for small hands. It's quick to check things and it also stores all her friends' phone numbers, etc. The calculator is very useful too. Fun and easy to use, there are more and more of them appearing in the classroom now.", "summary": "It's Amazing (says my 8 year old!)", "product_name": "Franklin SPELLING CORRECTOR", "product_id": "1567120709"}
