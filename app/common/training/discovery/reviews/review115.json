I've used plate holders and even copy stands from the stationary store in the past, but this is the Real McCoy.  Very nice cookbook holder.  Good quality.  Even holds Joy of Cooking.  I'm glad I finally invested in one.", "summary": "Great book holder", "product_name": "Mighty Bright 37401 Fold-n-Stow Book Holder", "product_id": "1891747401"}
