It will hold your book where your want it to be. It will save your neck and keep you hands free to take notes or whatever as you read. It is super lightweight and convenient. I just keep it in my backpack at all times. It handles my 1000 page law books, so no worries in that department. The price is right. I see other people clunking around those huge, expensive wood book stands. This is way better. Go with this.", "summary": "Must have for law student", "product_name": "Mighty Bright 37401 Fold-n-Stow Book Holder", "product_id": "1891747401"}
