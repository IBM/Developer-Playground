Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit, finish, and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating.", "summary": "Expensive but Worth It!", "product_name": "Tupperware Fresh & Pure Ice Tray Purple Set of 2", "product_id": "7213035835"}
