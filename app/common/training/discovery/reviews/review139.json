Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.  Works great for everything, but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.  It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).  Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.  Definitely a handy thing to have around.", "summary": "Love This", "product_name": "Mighty Bright 37401 Fold-n-Stow Book Holder", "product_id": "1891747401"}
