I appreciate how this guide gives tips on how to bake the perfect cake, and also gives detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use the pastry bag to make many different designs. I do, however, agree that this book did appear to be an advertisment for thier products, but the guide was helpful nonetheless.", "summary": "Great For Beginners!", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
