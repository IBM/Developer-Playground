I use this container for that.  The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.  The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.  I've had mine for five to ten years, and it is still good as new.  I just bought one for my mother.  She had her red beets eggs in a jar, which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.  I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.  I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.  I also know someone who uses hers, without the strainer, to store brown sugar.  So, it is a multi-purpose container.", "summary": "Great for pickled eggs.", "product_name": "Tupperware Large Pick a Deli Container", "product_id": "7802215811"}
