Most containers aren't big enough to hold them. These are perfect.* They have plenty of room - I don't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close. I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins. 9/9/11 Update: I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins. I think it would hold 20 if you work at it. With 16, I can just drop them in and pop the lid on.* They are compact enough to fit into a jeans pocket.Yep, the lid is hard to get off the first couple of times. No worries after that. The bonus is that a snug lid means I don't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins. Nice!My daughter loves these in her purse, too.The uses are practically endless (aspirin, gum, paper clips, skittles :)HIGHLY Recommended!", "summary": "Perfect for vitamins, etc.", "product_name": "Tupperware Smidgets in Pink and Red Set of 5", "product_id": "7535549756"}
