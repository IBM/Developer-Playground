They are a great quality, perfect size, and the thicker weight of the plastic makes them feel just right when holding them. The lip/edge is curved enough so it doesn't feel sharp. They also have a pretty wide base, which I imagine helps them tip over less. My 2 year old does good with them, and I like to drink juice out of them as well.", "summary": "GREAT kid cups", "product_name": "Ikea Kalas 101.929.56 BPA-Free Tumbler, Assorted Colors, 6-Pack, Set of 2", "product_id": "9178894395"}
