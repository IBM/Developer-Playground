Also look carefully at the fork and knife, they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one.", "summary": "You get what you pay for", "product_name": "IKEA BONUS economical 16 PIECES FLATWARE SET , STAINLESS STEEL", "product_id": "9177124405"}
