They are just right for children.  They don't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill...and there is ALWAYS a spill...it isn't so bad.  I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf.  They've been holding up well.  We've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine. Get them.  They're terrific for families.", "summary": "perfect for our family", "product_name": "Ikea Kalas 101.929.56 BPA-Free Tumbler, Assorted Colors, 6-Pack, Set of 2", "product_id": "9178894395"}
