This book gave me so many great ideas and wonderful recipes as well!  This cake had a 16&#34; square base, 10&#34; sq middle layer and 6&#34; top layer all set 90 degrees.  For a first wedding cake, it was amazing with Wilton's help!  This book is a must have for newbies like me.", "summary": "Wilton Rocks!", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
