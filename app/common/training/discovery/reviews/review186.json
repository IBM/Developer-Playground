I reordered because I trust these cups.Easy wash, comes out of the dishwasher without being tweaked by the heat. Good size for children's hands under age 8 and holds enough to satisfy a child's thirst. The ribbed bottom helps prevent slipping through little fingers too.Overall, really like this product!", "summary": "Really nice, replacements for lost ones", "product_name": "Ikea Kalas 101.929.56 BPA-Free Tumbler, Assorted Colors, 6-Pack, Set of 2", "product_id": "9178894395"}
