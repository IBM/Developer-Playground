It is GREAT! It is easy to clean and I love that you can switch the blade from sharp to grind mode! I do recommend looking over the user guide for which blade side and speed for optimal chopping/processing. I had been using my full size Cuisinart to make her baby food prior to getting this, which as any one with the full size Cuisinart knows is a pain to drag out and I couldn't make just small portions for her. So, the Mini-Prep was the perfect solution for me! I have processed just about anything and everything in this so far and it has worked beautifully! I highly recommend this for any small job in the kitchen. Another plus is you are able to buy extra bowls so if you want to use it for coffee or spice grinding you can have a bowl specifically for those uses so other foods do not absorb the flavors of coffee or spices.", "summary": "Great little kitchen gadget!!!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
