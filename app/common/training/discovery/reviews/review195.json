He brought this home and well, I've been loving it ever since.  I do mostly use it for onions, but it is wonderful for spices and nuts too.  I just can't believe how powerful the motor is in this guy - it seems as if it could grind beef!  Mine has turned yellow (it was white) with use but I think I'm going to rebuy it in stainless steel.  Anyway, the price here on Amazon is quite good since my husband paid $34 for it 10 years ago!  I think I'm going to ahve to buy a larger one because this one is getting too small for our family. I don't like the way it cleans up, however, it can be a little much when you do onions. You HAVE to put it in the dishwasher for sure if you do onions because the plastic definitely holds the odor. Wish it was glass! Great machine for the money and I highly recommend it.", "summary": "A Great Little Machine", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
