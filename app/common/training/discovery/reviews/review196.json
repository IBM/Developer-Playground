It does a great job chopping onions, pecans, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.  I ordered this one for my daughter, and, she loves it.  I use this mini a lot more than I use my food processor.  The size works great, especially when baking!  I highly recommend!", "summary": "Love!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
