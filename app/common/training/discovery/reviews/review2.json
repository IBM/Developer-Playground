It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.", "summary": "Beautifully illustrated recipe and instruction book for Zoku pops", "product_name": "Zoku Quick Pops Recipe Book", "product_id": "0615391206"}
