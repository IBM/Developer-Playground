It does about 80 percent of what a large food processor does, and it's easier to clean and takes up less space.If you find you typically chop herbs, make pesto and blended sauces, herb butters and the like and do NOT use the food processor for batters, doughs and slicing, you might consider the Mini-Prep. The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp. I made a fresh tomato coulis out of tomato, dried tomato, oil and herbs in seconds and it had the right texture (chopped but not liquified.)One thing I hate about large food processors is scraping small amounts of chopped herbs or nuts out of the large bowl. If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect. It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too.The unit comes in steel color and white. Before you buy a food processor, consider what you typically process. If you do coffee, smoothies, pesto, chopped herbs and nuts and salsa, this may just be enough, saving you dollars and space.", "summary": "Does most of the jobs of a larger unit except for slicing", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
