I expect it will last a few months.  BUT, for the price I can either get it replaced or just keep buying new ones.  Not the best consumer mentality, but I think that's how it's going to be.  It IS very small.  I had anticipated making sauces with it but even for small meals you need to do it in several batches.  I tried shredding vegetables in it and it nipped away at the outer skin of it but left me with some round balls of vegetable matter that required quite a bit of shifting.  It's easy to clean and while it has quite a few drawbacks, I see this getting much more use than my larger machines because of it's overall ease.", "summary": "decent for what it is", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
