I like that it does not have a long chute sticking up on the lid.  It pulses nicely and chops up garlic and onions quickly.  I also liked that it had 2 speeds and you could pulse.  I bought it for its small size to put in my camper, but liked it so much it has a place in the house.", "summary": "LOVE my little chopper!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
