I saw this on a cooking show and immediately bought one. Best small processor ever!!  Others do not pick up all of the pieces off the bottom of the processor. This one picks up everything and creates a smooth blend of everything. Buy one for yourself and pass them out to the kids as Christmas presents!", "summary": "Fabulous processor!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
