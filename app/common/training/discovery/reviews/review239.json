Works well when you don't want to pull the full sized food processor out and assemble it and then clean it afterward. It'll chop a good sized onion up to start a pasta sauce, or a couple of hot peppers for a finishing to a stir fry. Very handy and pretty well built even for couple time per week usage year after year.", "summary": "Good for small batches", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
