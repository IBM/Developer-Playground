I crush dry beans and dog kibble easily and fast.  Have no need to process large amounts at a time as it would not stay fresh.  This one works nicely, efficently and cleans up so easily.  I process daily soups for my dogs.  This is just the right size.  Easy to use, clean and is versitile for wet foods and dry foods.  I would purchase it again for gifts if need to", "summary": "I LOVE IT", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
