The first one lasted about ten years, and I used it quite often, tho it was not abused.  Love the handiness of this item, it stores easily with a small footprint, parts go in the dishwasher for quick cleanup, just the right size for smaller jobs.", "summary": "replacement mini processor", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
