I lost my old one when I moved, and I tried a few different types, but I was never happy. I just had to get another mini-prep. It's easy to wash, very simple, and it does a very respectable job of chopping garlic and ginger and making small amounts of pesto, nut butter, or dressing. I use it pretty much every day and it never fails me.", "summary": "Indispensable", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
