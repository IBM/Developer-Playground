Its a good size for that purpose,small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However, i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it, used on HI as recommended, many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly, i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before, and the texture turn out perfect, just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy.", "summary": "Litte dissapointed after the first use", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
