I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant, so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed, but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades, two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit.", "summary": "Does a terrible job of chopping if your looking for a good one", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
