My only complaint is that it chops too finely (even using the pulse method and the correct blade) for my usual needs.  If you want really finely chopped onions, carrots, cheese, etc., done fast and easily, this is your gadget.  But it's a little too fine for everyday cooking for me.", "summary": "Good for very fine, fast chopping", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
