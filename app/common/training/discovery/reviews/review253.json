I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time, and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use, easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher, I think its ok to do so, but from past experience, these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying, so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!", "summary": "Great little kitchen helper", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
