This happened after 4-5 years of regular use, though, it wasn't new by any stretch of the imagination. I read reviews about other models thinking it might be time for a change - I was annoyed that Cuisinart wouldn't just sell me a new cover; I had to buy the whole basket and cover apparatus for nearly as much as a new machine. In the end, though, I did just buy a new one. This baby chops, dices, and is great for making emulsions for mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing.  The blade can be flipped over for different uses. If you read the directions that come with the product, they explain clearly how to use the appliance so that you don't get onion mush.  The only thing I don't do with it is grind spices - I have not had good luck with that and prefer to use an old coffee grinder. Otherwise, it does exactly what it says it does.", "summary": "Always have been happy with it . . .", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
