I pulse/chop carrots for salads, and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad, I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor, and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you, and I like small pieces of carrot in salads, not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces, dressing, and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one, except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking.", "summary": "Perfect for quick chopping of small amounts, easy to clean", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
