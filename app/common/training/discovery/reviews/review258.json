I use only four of the 7-speeds since you only really need high-medium-low settings. The glass is of excellent quality and very thick; I've banged it accidentally several times and there's not a scratch on it. The top has a great grip when you close it. The base is made of plastic and feels a little cheap. I'm not sure what else to say about this item, it blends well and it's easy to clean up after, simple as that!I admit I am a Cuisinart brand whore. I can't help it, they make well-designed appliances, that work fantastic, that match beautifully with my decor--a trifecta of perfection! And not one of them has failed on me (yet, fingers crossed).Recommended from me, but please take the other reviews into consideration.", "summary": "It's Blend-tastic!", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
