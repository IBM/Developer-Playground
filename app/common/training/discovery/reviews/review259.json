My first project was to grind chicken to make burgers. I sliced the breasts into long pieces and laid them on the blades. No sooner had I turned it on low when the job was done! I went through 3 breasts in less than 3 minutes. This is really a time saver. Too bad some others did not have such good luck. I also love the deep red color. Great purchase.", "summary": "Mine works fine!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
