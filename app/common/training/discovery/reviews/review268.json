We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry \"ice cream\" using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first.", "summary": "Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
