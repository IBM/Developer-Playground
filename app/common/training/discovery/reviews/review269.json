Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First, freeze the bowl overnight. Second, chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla, not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things, I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream, which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things, I've found that I create milkshakes, and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly, the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly, and I'll experiment with those recipes.", "summary": "A great product", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
