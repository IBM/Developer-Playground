Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews, I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok, especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well, let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold, it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency, but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!", "summary": "Ah, homemade ice cream", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
