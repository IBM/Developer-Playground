I put the frozen bowl part in our upright freezer at least a few hours before I expect to make ice cream.  I make the custard for the ice cream at the same time.  After dinner, I put the frozen part on the stand, put in the mixing blade and top with the lid.  Then I pour the custard in and 20-30 minutes later we enjoy fresh ice cream with no additives.  If you want ice cream that is harder than soft serve, it will need to \"ripen\" a bit more in your freezer.  But this is a delightful machine that I highly recommend.  I never made ice cream before it, and never want to buy it from a grocery again.", "summary": "Exactly what I needed, works perfectly", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
