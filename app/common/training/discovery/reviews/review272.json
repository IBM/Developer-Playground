I've used it countless times since I got it for Christmas two years ago.  It's easy, user-friendly, makes delicious ice cream.  Buy a second freezer bowl to go with it, so you always have a fully-frozen one on hand...especially if you're making more than one flavor or want two batches at once.", "summary": "The Best, The Easiest, Buy It", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
