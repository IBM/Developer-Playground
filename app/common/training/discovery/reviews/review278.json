I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors. There is a possibility that the glass jar is not correctly placed on the base which could lead to accelerated wear of the plastic connectors. This should not happen with a bit of care. Only bit of criticism that I have is that the blender could be slightly faster and blend more foamy.", "summary": "Solid Blender", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
