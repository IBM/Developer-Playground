I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time, but I used it very rarely).  I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.  After a few more years of use the plastic mechanism in the base of the unit that spins the blades split in two.My husband and I were going to throw it in the trash, but then felt a wave of guilt about how in our consumeristic culture we never repair things anymore, etc.  So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].  When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.  THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer, which doesn't have any plastic moving parts.", "summary": "Plastic parts break", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
