It works great even when run for long periods (some mustard seeds must be processed for 6-8 minutes to reach proper grind). It has plenty of power and has also now been put to use grinding romano cheese. It's just a lot easier to use when I don't need the capacity of my 14 cup processor.", "summary": "Great small food processor", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
