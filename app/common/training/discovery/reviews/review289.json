All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart, plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice, repackage the unit, deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again, why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later.", "summary": "At $40 they are still overpriced and all but worthless", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
