My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.  I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.  In my area the Wilton Method instructors are not so great so I am happy I was able to save the money on the class but still get all of the wonderful Wilton advice.  I would definitely recommend not only buying this book, but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class.", "summary": "Awesome  book", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
