With a only 6 months of service, the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again, I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened!  The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!", "summary": "Glad for a warrantee", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
