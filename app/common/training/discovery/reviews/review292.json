The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit. I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.  So if you are doing a lot of entertaining, you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also, you should look at the recipe book.  The recipe book gives you hints on how to \"layer\" the ingredients.I made some awesome hummus by following their directions.As I said earlier, if you are doing heavy blending work with ice you may need a professional unit.  I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill.", "summary": "Very good but not perfect", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
