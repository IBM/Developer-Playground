Liquids! Not even thick sauces or heaven forbid ICE -- despite the advertisement of this item as a \"bar blender.\"Well, guess what? It broke again, when blending a thin soup.  I'm not going to waste any more money sending this thing back to Cuisinart and will have to think twice about buying appliances from Cuisinart again.", "summary": "Not again", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
