I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder, be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer.", "summary": "Great product - great coffee..", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
