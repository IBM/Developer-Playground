I followed the directions enclosed with this machine and found that it produced a weak, pallid cup of coffee.  Ok, so no problem I just added more coffee beans and less water and so on and so on.  What I noticed when I faithfully cleaned the parts of the machine daily is that there was quite a bit of coffee left in the grinder and the screen and that a cup of coffee was now costing me 60% more because of this design/operational flaw. In other words I was having to use 60% more beans in order to produce a strong cup of coffee because much of the bean grind was wasted. So figure it out.  With coffee beans costing approx $10-$12 a pound [where I'm at] this coffee maker is nothing but a BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY! I would definitely not recommend this machine to anyone.  In fact I'm going to repack it and give it to my hateful brother for Christmas.", "summary": "A BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
