You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also, the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!", "summary": "Great coffee but a huge pain to clean!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
