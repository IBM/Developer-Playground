I had a Cuisinart Duet before - which still works but it's not nearly as pretty as this pink one.  It's reasonably quiet and does the job.  Cuisinart machines are generally a good investment.  I'll have to use it more to see if it's really a great product.", "summary": "Awesome blender", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
