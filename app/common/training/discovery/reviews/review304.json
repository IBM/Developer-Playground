The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time, neither of which I have.  This is the best though.  The ice cream is so good and really easy.  I've only had this ice cream maker 4 days and I've already made vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream and peach frozen yogurt and each one is delicious.  It makes the perfect amount for a family, not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.  And it's so easy.  Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream.", "summary": "So yummy!!!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
