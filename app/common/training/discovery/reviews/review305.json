This summer however, has been a different story and I have loved making ice cream with it.This machine is so versatile and convenient, you will be using it to make ice cream all the time--for parties, for yourself, anytime.  The only effort required from you is making your base mix (custard, sorbet, whatever you want basically) then you put the liquid mix into the cold bowl and turn the machine on.  No additional effort is required--until you're ready to turn the machine off and eat 20 minutes later!  The machine has a convenient opening on its top so you can add mix ins as your ice cream starts to freeze, or so you can just watch your liquid mix turn from liquid to wonderful ice cream.The only warning I would issue with this machine is that the freezer bowl is pretty big, so if you have a small freezer or one packed with food it may be hard to make space for it.  The bowl MUST be frozen for 18-24 hours before use to get a good freeze for your ice cream, so being able to store this bowl in the freezer is critical to getting good results.", "summary": "You'll be addicted to homemade ice cream!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
