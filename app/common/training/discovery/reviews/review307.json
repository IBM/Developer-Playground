As sugguested I waited two days before trying it out.I mixed the ingredients for the basic Vanilla (except a few changes: 1c Heavy CR, 1c Light CR, 1/2c soy Milk, 1/2c half & Half, 2tsp vanilla ex, whatever amount of sugar it asked for, and added some green tea powder), and placed it in the fridge for about an hr-hr & a half. After pouring the ingredients in the top I let it go for 25 min. (as suggested instead of 30)and whalaThe ice cream came out deliciously soft serve! I put it in the freezer after eating about a cup and this morning I took another sample. It was a hard icecream on the softer side of the spectrum. Still so good!I can't wait to try another flavor, frozen yogurt, and eventually premium(hard, I'm guessing). If your after a nice automatic ice cream machine, this (so far) has seemed like a great deal for the money (even though it's a little higher then I was hoping to spend).", "summary": "Looks Nice, Works Great.
