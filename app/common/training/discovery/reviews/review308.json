Simple recipes work fine.  Cold mixing turned out as good a product as heating then cooling.Pros: This Cuisinart ICE-20 is quiet enough to run in the kitchen/dining area while we are eating.  It is easy to set up, use and clean.  It turns out a nice product - good enough to serve guests.  We like being able to have ice cream with less sugar and no chemicals.  It is entertaining to watch the process through the clear top opening.Cons: The plastic scraper/turner doesn't fit the bowl closely enough which leaves a thin layer of frozen ice cream to be scraped off.  Making less than ~3 cups of ice cream results in reduced aeration because the ice cream mix comes below the level of the plastic cross piece that mixes it.The best deal that I found now was at Williams Sonoma where the unit with a second bowl is $59.95.  The second best deal is Linens & Things where a 20% off coupon will bring the cost from $49.99 to $40 but they don't offer additional bowls.  The bowls cost about $30.", "summary": "Ice cream maker gives outstanding bang for the buck", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
