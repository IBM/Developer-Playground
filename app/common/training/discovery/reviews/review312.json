My husband and I are vegan, so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog, A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time, so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe, because it can be a pain to clean, especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still, it's not too difficult, and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it.", "summary": "Makes great vegan ice cream", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
