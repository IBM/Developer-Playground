We've been using this for almost two years with no problems and are pleased with the design.  The running noise sounds like a small motor, neiterh jarringly loud nor quiet as a whisper.Keep the bowl in the freezer if you want to be able to make ice cream or frozen yogurt on a whim.  Cleanup is very easy, and the ice cream is comparable to soft serve when you're first done making it or you can freeze it for an hour or two if you want it to be more solid.  It's great to make any flavor you want any time, and to be able to control the fat content and quality of the ingredients.The booklet included contains about 20 recipes plus variations, including a number of ice creams, frozen lemonade, frozen pudding, frozen yogurts, several fruit sorbets and a couple of frozen  potent potables. These basic recipes are good and will get you started, but there are also some very good books of recipes available, such as The Ultimate Ice Cream Book.A very good, dependable machine.  Highest recommendation.", "summary": "this will be one of your favorite small appliances!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
