I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt.  It is so easy to use.  I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt.  It was quick and easy to assemble.  I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes.  It was louder then I anticipated, but nothing crazy.  It froze perfectly and tasted wonderful.  I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams, sorbets, sherbets, frozen yogurts, and even frozen slushy drinks.  This thing is awesome.  It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean.", "summary": "Quick and easy to use", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
