It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had, and this machine makes it so easy to make, just pour in the ingredients and turn it on, set a timer and you can relax, when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever! Try it, you will love it!", "summary": "Happy Happy!!!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
