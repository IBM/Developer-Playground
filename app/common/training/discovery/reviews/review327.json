It's easy, taste so much better than anything you can buy, and it's fun to be creative.  We never have left over icecream sitting in the freezer now, and when we want some, I keep cream handy in the fridge, so we just toss the ingredients into a blender, pour it into the already frozen bowl, and \"Voila\" 30 minutes later we have icecream !!!  Fastest dessert I've ever made, and always a big hit.
