The first batch came out a bit icy, although okay; I decided that freezing the bowl for 2-3 hours isn't enough, and, perhaps the room was too warm.  ... Next batch, I let the bowl freeze for a full 24 hours in the back of my freezer, and also, when running the machine, I covered the open &quot;hole&quot; in the cover of the machine with a piece of aluminum foil to keep the cold in.  That second batch came out very, very good; in the freezer, it ended up freezing quite hard but smooth &amp; consistent.  So, I tried to find a way to keep it softer.  For my third batch, I had the brilliant idea of first whipping the cream a bit, for a minute or two, before I used it (something not in any instructions) and that REALLY made GREAT ice cream!!!  (I used a portable Salton-type hand mixer, which whipped the cream a little bit, adding some air, but didn't really make it &quot;whipped cream&quot;.)In all other regards, it's important to read and follow all instructions.  Then, with the above suggestion to whip the heavy cream slightly before you combine everything, you'll get ice cream that is simply superb, the perfect texture that exactly matches what you'll get in stores, even though you don't add any stiffeners or carageenan etc.I have not tried other ice cream makers, but I have had such excellent results with this one, that if I were purchasing one, I would just get this and not take chances on lesser brands.", "summary": "Suggestions &amp; Helpful Hints", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
