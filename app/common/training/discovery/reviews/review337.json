So far I have made dark chocolate gelato that came out fantastic, and some strawberry frozen yogurt.  After 25-30 minutes in the machine, the consistency and texture are quite good...definitely hard enough to eat immediately.  I wish the recipe book was bigger, but I found the gelato recipe on line (epicurious, I believe) and it worked fine (except the custard is kind of a pain to make, lots of stirring and constant attention...).  After having lived in Italy for a year, I really missed creamy Italian gelato, and so now I have my own way to make it.  And it's also nice because I know exactly what goes into every batch.  After you remove the leftovers to the freezer, it is necessary to let them defrost for a little while before serving them, because the ice cream/yogurt, etc. gets hard (no commercial softeners in there).  Not a big deal though.  This machine is pretty loud, but nothing too unbearable.  I would recommend it for anyone interested in a small, easy to clean, easy to use, ice cream maker.", "summary": "Works great! easy to operate.", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
