It is everything I expected.  The design is easy to manage.  I have to say though, I am still working on getting perfect, creamy ice-cream from it while using quality ingredients.  Sorbets turn out wonderful!  Overall, I am glad I have this gadget in my kitchen!  Playing with the idea of a perfect ice-cream is delicious in itself!", "summary": "It works, it turns... but I am still working on perfect ice-cream!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
