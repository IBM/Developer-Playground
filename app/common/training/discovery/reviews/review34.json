I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set, that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas, from Amazon,that work very well. I also bought the bench knife, and found a 16\" cake lifter, and a 18\" cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon, however, the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book, great starter outer! Oh yes, I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely,Super Chef David", "summary": "Wilton Decorating Basics Lesson Plan", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
