I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.  I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk, condesed milk, and cocoa powder.  At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.  It didn't swish when I shook it, so I thought I was good to go.  After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.  I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.  After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.  I will never buy ice cream from the store again.  This ice cream maker is awesome, I love it.", "summary": "Heavenly", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
