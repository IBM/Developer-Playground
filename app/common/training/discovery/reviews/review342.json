I strongly disagree.  I have used this beauty for dessert 4 or 5 nights a week since getting it over a month ago.  I mix up the ingredients and put them in the refrigerator to thoroughly cool, then put the freezer together and pour it in.  10 to 20 minutes later, it's ready (depends on exact mix).  If you think it's too soft, you're not used to home-made ice cream!  The outside of the freezer tub is not metal, but I don't think it could be with the material inside it which has to expand.  Obviously you have to be aware of that.  The interior of the tub is stronger and I use my plastic ice cream scooper and hard plastic spatula to get every drop of the goodies every time.  This is a champ.  We've probably made enough homemade goodies already to pay for it if you think about how much we would have paid for that much ice cream or frozen dessert.", "summary": "Nothing but good", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
