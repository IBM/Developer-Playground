Also, you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.  My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.  Other than that, its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.  If you really like ice cream or have a large family, you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.  The ice cream will go fast!", "summary": "Good if bowl frozen enough!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
