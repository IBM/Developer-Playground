Costco finally started carrying them for around $30, so I decided I wasn't out much if I didn't like it.Works great.  I love homemade ice cream but it is such a pain to make, especially since I am single.  The ice cream freezes great if you use an airtight bowl and still tastes freshly made.  Stays pretty soft as well, almost like having tasty soft serve ice cream.  I make the basic vanilla and cut the recipe in half and cut the time down in the machine to about 20 minutes and it works out great for a single person.  You have ice cream to eat on the spot and leftovers for a couple more bowls.One thing I don't like about the recipes in the book is they are all high calorie.  They call for whole milk and heavy cream.  I am going to try the one suggestion next time and use half and half instead of cream and see if that works to cut down on the calories", "summary": "Very easy to make and clean up.
