The bowl is so large around that I have not been able to find anything to fit it and must resort to plastic wrap or tin foil. This is EXTREMELY annoying and almost enough to make me wish I didn't buy it, you can't clean the bowl when it is frozen. The way the bowl is manufactured a standard snap cover would work on it, it would have been simple and cheap for them to provide one. I would have liked a cover for it while it's in operation too, the top is open and I like things covered so nothing falls in while making the ice cream. It could have been designed with one cover for both. The feet are also poorly designed, the rubber feet are too short and slide all the way into their holes so it can sit on plastic and be hard to level. This machine is the kind of design that makes you wonder if they ever tested it before manufacturing it.Still, for the price it works well and if it had a cover and properly designed feet it would rate another star.", "summary": "good but could be better", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
