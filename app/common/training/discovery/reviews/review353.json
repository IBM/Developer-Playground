I purchased ICE-20FR on February 6, 2002 from Amazon for $29.99 re-conditioned and I am so happy I discovered it on Amazon and tried it!  I recommend buying a second bowlCuisinart 1-1/2-Quart Additional Freezer Bowl, fits ICE-20 Ice Cream Makerto freeze so that way you can always be ready to make another flavor; when I purchased mine they were $29.99 as well!  Also presentation is fun so check outAnchor Hocking Tulip Sundae Fountainware, Clear, Set of 12.  When/if my ever breaks, I would buy another one on amazon PRONTO.  I don't remember ever having a single problem with it not freezing but I use very natural healthy products and it sounds like some other reviewers were unknowingly putting anti-freeze in theirs not being aware of it.  I most often don't follow a recipe but simply create my own.  My easiest creation is simply pouring in half a quart of Blueberry Pomegranate Cultured Goat Milk Kefir and that froze fine and was great!  I also often use coconut milk, some sweetener choice, and a flavor!  I add fresh fruits in the ice cream or afterwards as topping.  I don't think I ever threw out any of my creations and I am very picky and do throw out other non-frozen recipes.  I think my secret is to taste it before freezing it; if you don't like it the taste unfrozen, you won't like it frozen!", "summary": "Almost  8 1/2 years old and going strong!
