There are a lot of great features to this machine. I like the 1.5 quart capacity, because most recipes that say they're 1 quart are actually more when frozen, so I rarely have leftover mix.The opening in the top makes it easy to start the freezing process without having the dasher stick to the can. It's also great for last-minute additions, which I do a lot because I generally add a bit of vodka at the end to keep my ice cream from getting too hard.I purchased an extra bowl and it's come in handy many, many times. Sometimes you don't want 1.5 quarts of the same flavor, so I'll make the custard base and turn it into two different flavors of ice cream and I can freeze them one after the other. The extra bowl also helps if I'm in a hurry and don't want to totally chill the mix. Then I chill it almost to the freezing point in one and move it to the second one. Buy an extra bowl!!", "summary": "Wonderful Machine!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
