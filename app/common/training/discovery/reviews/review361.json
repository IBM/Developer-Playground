It makes ice cream and other frozen treats super fast, is easy to clean, compact, and not too loud. Sure, it's not whisper quiet, but I didn't think the noise level was unbearable and conversation is easy to hear over it. Cuisinart appliances have always seemed to be reliable so let's hope this one is no exception.", "summary": "Great toy!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
