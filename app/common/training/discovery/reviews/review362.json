The freezer is a variation on the popular &quot;Donvier&quot; type ice cream makers with a cold insert that is previously frozen and a churn paddle that stirs the mixture and shell-freezes it to the sides of the cold container. But instead of hand-cranking the shell-frozen ice cream, the Cuisinart has a well-designed paddle that is angled perfectly to scrape the ice cream off the sides as it freezes. In 20 minutes, you have a frozen treat that is ok for low-carb diets if you follow the recipe.A couple of hints; I froze the container well in advance, and after making the ice cream, I washed, dried and froze it again for its next use. The ice cream custard was cooled to room temp and I used a dairy thermometer to measure the temperature. Chilling the custard would have resulted in an even firmer mass, but I was impatient. In either case, non-sugar ice cream will set up very hard in the freezer, so it's best to consume it on the same day you freeze it, and serve it soon after you make it.This is a very economical alternative to expensive freezers with built-in refrigeration, and works much better than the hand version of the device.", "summary": "This works like a charm", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
