Well made and easy clean up.  The biggest problem I have noticed is that relatively few people know how cold their freezer is (as well as their fridge).  I bought a device to show me the temps and now i keep my freezer at 0F and my fridge at 34F-35F - and I have not had any problems keeping the bowl cold enough to freeze up the cream.  So easy and fast - as well as fresh good ingredients have made possessing this machine a delight.  I highly recommend it as well as recommending all of us periodically checking the temps in both our freezers and fridges.There are 2 main reasons for failure to get the ice cream to freeze - first is your freezer is not cold enough to freeze the bowl through and through.  The 2nd reason is inappropriate ingredients that prevent the cream from freezing.  Some of these ingredients are anything with alcohol, fresh citrus fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, etc) and kiwi - amongst some others.  Seems to me that anything that will prevent jello from 'setting' will also prevent ice cream from freezing properly.  The ice cream when it is done will also not be hard, like the ice cream you get in stores, but of the soft variety that you get from like a Diary Queen - soft ice cream.  If you want it firmer or harder, put it into a different container and put it back in the freezer.  Now get creative and enjoy the fruits of your labors :)", "summary": "Make sure your freezer is COLD enough", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
