I've had my ice cream maker for about a week now and I have used it 3 times and so far, so good! It only takes about 20 minutes to make delicious ice cream or sorbets. Some of the recipes in the booklet (and in other recipes online or in other books) might require some additional prep work. The ice cream maker makes 1-1/2 quarts which is more than enough for my husband and I to enjoy. It's quick, easy and contains less preservatives than store bought.The only issue I have with it is the mixing attachment is made of plastic. It feels like it has to be handled very gingerly or it will snap in two. At times I am concerned that I will make an ice cream that is too thick for it to handle. I hope this thing last a long time so we can get many uses out of it. I'll update if and when it breaks.", "summary": "Excellent, just one small issue", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
