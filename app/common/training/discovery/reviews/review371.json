I considered purchasing an ice cream maker for over 5 years and I FINALLY convinced myself that it was worth it.  I should have bought this years ago.  I originally thought I'd seldom use it, but it's very easy to use and turns out great tasting results!I have no complaints.  I love making desserts and ice cream is easier than baking, and a great way to avoid heating up your kitchen during the summer when you want a homemade dessert.  The recipe book included with the unit has great basic ideas (I especially enjoy the Coffee Ice Cream, I add toffee to mine).  From there, the possibilities are endless!If you can measure, you can make ice cream.  The most basic ice creams have 3 or 4 ingredients and if you are the type who enjoys stopping at expensive ice cream shops for gourmet flavors, this unit will save you money in the long run.  The 1.5 quart capacity makes just enough ice cream for you to satisfy your craving without over-indulging (and maybe share with friends and family!).Oh, yes, the machine is a bit loud, but it only takes 20 minutes to make a batch.  The noise reminds me to keep checking my ice cream to see if it's \"done\".  Doesn't bother me at all.Bottom line... great price, good ice cream, you can't go wrong with this!", "summary": "If you LIVE for ice cream...", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
