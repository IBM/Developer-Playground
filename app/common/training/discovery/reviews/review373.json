It works best if you make sure that the bowl is 100% frozen solid, which means leaving it in the freezer at least overnight.  Also once you've made your mix, put that in the freezer too for a little while so it's very cold.  I also add the mix to the bowl and then the paddle and then the lid, because if you try to pour it in thru the hole in the lid, like the directions say, you end up with a mess all over the counter.Another thing I've learned is don't even attempt to make the 'kids' ice cream recipe in the book, the one that uses instant pudding mix.  This just makes cement.  You can't eat it and it practically ruined the bowl!  I had to soak it in boiling water and scrape it off with a metal scraper! What a disaster!The easiest, creamiest ice cream recipe is just to use 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup half and half, 3/4 cup fine ground sugar and 2 tbsps of real vanilla extract.  Easy. Creamy. Yummy.
