I just used the recipes that came with the machine. So far, the strawberry was the best. Each batch consistently took 25 minutes to make. It's easy to use and easy to clean. I bought the red unit which adds a fun color to my kitchen when not in use. The opening at the top is also convenient for scooping up a spoonful of ice cream for tasting without turning the unit off. I'm sorry I didn't buy this sooner. I love how simple and easy it is to use. I'm going to start experimenting with my own recipes now that I've got the hang of it.The only very minor downside is that it's a little noisy while it's running so you can't really enjoy a quiet meal and make dessert at the same time unless you can stick it in a another room. But I just make a batch early before dinner and store it in the freezer while we're eating.", "summary": "Simple to use, yummy ice cream", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
