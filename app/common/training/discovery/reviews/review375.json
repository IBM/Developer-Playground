On only its second use, the motor hummed and wouldn't start for several minutes. It did this consistently over the next year but would start up after 5 or 10 minutes. However, now the motor just stops halfway through the process because it's overheating too quickly. Maybe I just got a lemon, but this is a pretty poor motor.", "summary": "Makes great ice cream, but motor has problems", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
