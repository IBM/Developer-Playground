Very easy to use and clean and good basic recipes included in the appliance's booklet.  If you want a lighter ice cream that doesn't have such a fatty aftertaste, however, try 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I wish Cuisinart would include some vegan options using almond and coconut milk, too.", "summary": "A very worthwhile little appliance!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
