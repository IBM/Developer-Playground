It is very quiet (a bit louder than your average microwave) and doesn't take up much counter space.  However, it is definitely not for impulse ice-cream eaters.  You have to pre-freeze the maker's bowl for about 12 hours prior to making ice-cream and all the ingredients you pour into the maker have to be chilled for at least an hour or two, and then it takes about half an hour to an hour for the ice-cream to solidify.The maker comes with a small instruction booklet and some recipes.  The recipes are by no means plentiful but offer an idea how to make good ice-cream.  If you know anything about cooking, it won't be too hard for you to figure out new recipes, but if you don't, you can always buy one of the ice-cream recipe books.The good thing about this maker is that you control exactly what goes into your ice-cream, so it's an alternative if you're on a diet (whether to lose weight or just can't eat walnuts).  If make the ingredients before making dinner and have the bowl pre-frozen, you can let the ice-cream set during your dinner and end up having a nice dessert afterwards.  It's great family fun, from what I hear.The only downside though is that most ice-cream you make in this maker comes out a bit too soft and requires further freezing in the freezer (about 2 hours).  So if you like your ice-cream vey solid, you are probably better off just getting a pint of Ben & Jerry's.", "summary": "Great ice-cream maker for beginners and kitchen pros.", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
