Well, this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight, when it's thoroughly frozen, you put it on the base, fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire, put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later, or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also, by the way, it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry.", "summary": "Very easy to operate, easy to clean, makes great ice cream!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
