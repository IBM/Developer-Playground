I followed the instructions to the letter. The freezer container was kept at 0 degrees for &#62;24 hours. The mix was kept in the frid for 6 hours to hopefully assist in keeping things cold. The unit works well and within 15 minutes I had a nice batch of soft serve. However all the unit does is save you the trouble of mixing the batch by hand. I think Ice Cream means it shouldn't flow out of the container until it melts. This it pour-able into a dish. On a hot day of say 85 degrees, this wouldn't last long enough to lick a cone of it before it was running down your arm. I can deal with hand mixing from now on and placing the batch in the freezer and waiting.", "summary": "Not an Ice Cream Maker", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
