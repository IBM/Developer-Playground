Without the hassle of using ice or salt, you're always ready to whip up some homemade ice cream!  I've made variations of vanilla, eggnog, lemon, cinnamon, dulce de leche, and others in this.  This machine makes ice-cream making SO much fun. I highly recommend this!", "summary": "I love this thing!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
