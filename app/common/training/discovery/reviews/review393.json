To be honest, I thought that making home-made ice cream would be just too  difficult, but with the Cuisinart, I've made it three times in the past  week.  You simple mix-up the ingredients, chill, and then pour into the  pre-frozen bowl.  Perfect every time.  I highly recommend the book,  &quot;Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream, Sorbetti &amp; Granite&quot; by Pamela  Sheldon Johns as a great add-on.  I ordered the book with the hope of being  able to duplicate the Stracciatella(?) Gelato I had while on vacation in  Italy.  The recipe was simple (heavy cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and  shaved chocolate) and the results were fabulous.This machine would  make a great gift as well!", "summary": "Simple to Use!
