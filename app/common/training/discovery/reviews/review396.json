This is just as easy as running to the store and buying a carton of additive-packed ice cream. Freeze the bowl, mix your ingredients, fire it up, add your mixture, blend-blend-blend, ice cream. The owner's manual comes with many recipes and with sites like Pinterest I have discovered many more. One of my favorites is 1 cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate, 3 cups milk, and 3 tbsp Splenda for a tangy frozen treat. I use fat free milk, so I tend to get 'icier' blends than using full fat milk for creamier results, but softening at room temp for a minute or two makes it very easy to scoop and a batch lasts about a week (mostly because it is my daily treat). A tip: do not use a metal sppon to scrape the bowl, it will leave unsightly scratch marks. Hopefully I did not ruin my bowl by doing that.", "summary": "so easy to use", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
