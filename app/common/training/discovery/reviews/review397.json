I was a little apprehensive, since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet, operated smoothly, and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine, but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also, due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker, we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it.", "summary": "Great Ice Cream Maker!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
