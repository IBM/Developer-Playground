Each one is a different color, and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated, of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored, foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book, and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies, and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!", "summary": "My little one absolutely loved this book", "product_name": "Good Night, Sweet Butterflies: A Color Dreamland", "product_id": "0689027818"}
