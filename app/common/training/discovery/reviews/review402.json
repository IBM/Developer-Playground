I've made half of them now; some were awesome, some good, some didn't work. The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so, which I found strange. An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy, but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks. Overall, for $60, it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!", "summary": "YUM YUM GOOD!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
