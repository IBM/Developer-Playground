I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess, quick, easy, home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks, too, including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction, powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve, but it's really true, if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours, it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this, because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice, but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable.", "summary": "The only thing better than ice cream", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
