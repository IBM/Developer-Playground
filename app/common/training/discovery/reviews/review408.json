I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review, but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is, I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says, because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh, and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream, and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching, this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!", "summary": "Easy,Fast and FUN!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
