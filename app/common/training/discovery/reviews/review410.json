I even bought an extra freezer bowl in case I want to make 2 flavors the same day.  I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften.  And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream won't freeze - just gets thick.  But it's a great item, and doesn't take up much space on the counter. I'm especially happy with it since I can't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance.  So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it's very satisfactory!", "summary": "TERRIFIC !!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
