Works perfectly, just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream, ice milk, bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients, I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it, but the quality is far superior to store bought, and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream.", "summary": "I Love It!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
