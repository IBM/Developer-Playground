All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.  The ice cream was not creamy and melty, it was either icy or fudgy.  I like the machine, it is easy to use, but also quite loud.  We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.  I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well.  The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream, but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it.", "summary": "Good little machine...
