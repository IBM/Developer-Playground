We have both made ice cream the old fashioned way and the Cuisinart is so easy! We keep the bowl in the freezer ready to go! The bowl does need to freeze at least overnight. We run the ice cream maker for 30 min. It makes a nice soft serve ice cream, if you want it firmer put it in a container the freezer. The unit cleans up easily. I give this 5 stars!", "summary": "Makes Great Ice Cream!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
