It is so easy and convenient to use, and in 20-25 minutes you have soft serve ice cream.  If you want to freeze it hard, just put it in the freezer for awhile if there is any left after you taste your results over and over again!  Also, if you make a lot of ice cream, be sure to pick up the extra freezer container.  Keep one in the freezer at all times and you are never caught without one that is ready to go!", "summary": "Fabulous! Easy!
