I have never been disappointed with the results. It sure is a little inconvenient, as you will have to freeze the bowl beforehand, and the machine is quite loud.1) Do not expect it to taste like store bought Ice Cream.2) Do not expect it to cost less, I think store bought Ice Creams are cheaper.3) You can be imaginative and create your own flavor blends.Overall, very satisfied.", "summary": "Excellent Starter Ice Cream Maker", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
