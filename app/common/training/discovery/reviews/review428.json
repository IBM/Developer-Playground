You can have fresh homemade ice cream in about 30 minutes from start to finish!  YUM!  It is great just for fun, it is great to use for entertaining, it is great for hot summer days.  I found that Sam's Club has Half and Half as well as fresh Whipping Cream for a great price, so it makes using this machine even more fun!", "summary": "Wonderful Ice Cream Maker", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
