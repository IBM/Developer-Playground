Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise, no mess,  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers, you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts, which is just enough for one starving person, or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web.", "summary": "So Easy To Use", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
