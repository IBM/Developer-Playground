I was careful before requesting it to check the temperature of my freezer. If your freezer doesn't maintain a temperature of between 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit, your ice cream probably won't turn out that well. Mine stays at a chilly zero degrees, and I've been amazed at how quickly this machine makes great frozen desserts. I've made the full-fat ice creams, a couple of sherbets, and frozen yogurt -- everything froze quickly and evenly, and came out with fantastic texture and flavor. It's been a great gift. I keep the bowl in the freezer, wrapped in a plastic bag and filled with frozen vegetables, so it's always ready to go.", "summary": "I love this thing!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
