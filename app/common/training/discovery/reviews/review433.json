You just pour in your pre-mixed, chilled ingredients, press start, and set a kitchen timer.  20-30 minutes later, the ice cream comes out like soft serve, which is great, but you can pour it into a freezer container and firm it up if you'd like, (which I did because it was for a birthday party later in the day).  My only complaint is that it's a little noisy.  I wouldn't recommend running it while you're trying to watch a movie or something.  I'm looking forward to using this more when the weather warms up here in Michigan.", "summary": "Love it after one use.", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
