I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was \"awesome.\" I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise, but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet, but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender.", "summary": "Very easy way to make homemade ice cream", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
