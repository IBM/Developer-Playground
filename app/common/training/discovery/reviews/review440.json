I actually bought two units - the 2nd one as a back-up - and, removed all of the \"ON\" and \"OFF\" trippers from the back-up unit to use on this one.  This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles, and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.  I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.  It keeps our area perfectly dehumidified, and the humidity rise is only 4% to 5% during the OFF cycle.I would recommend this timer to anyone considering a use similar to mine.", "summary": "Works Great So Far!", "product_name": "Intermatic TN311C 120 Volt Heavy Duty Grounded Timer", "product_id": "B00002N5FO"}
