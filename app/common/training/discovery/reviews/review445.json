The dial turns but it gets stuckat the pins. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem so I'm here to buy another brand.UPDATE: After i wrote the above I took the unit and kept spinning the dial to loosen it up.I plugged it back in & found it WOULD now turn on but not OFF. So i repeated spinning the dial over & over & finally, now it's working properly.", "summary": "it didn't work at first", "product_name": "Intermatic TN311C 120 Volt Heavy Duty Grounded Timer", "product_id": "B00002N5FO"}
