However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough, but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to \"save money\" and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings.", "summary": "Work great, reliable, but use lots of power.
