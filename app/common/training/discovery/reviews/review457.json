Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home, when the ice cream is done, it will . . . still be soft, but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.\"  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy, but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen.", "summary": "Simple and Elegant--Works Every Time", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
