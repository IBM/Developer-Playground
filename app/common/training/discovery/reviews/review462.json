It's easier to use than any other ice cream maker I've ever owned.  However, there are a couple of things to remember or you're going to be very frustrated by the experience.  First off, the freezer bowl has to be frozen solid.  Near solid isn't good enough.  I suggest you leave the bowl in your freezer for two days just to make sure it's cold enough.  Be sure your ingredients are very cold, too.  I use condensed and/or evaporated milk in a couple of my recipes and a day or two in the refrigerator is really important.  Room temperature just won't cut it.  And the thicker the better with this machine.  A custard base is an excellent way to start.Next, don't dawdle.  Get your ingredients right into the bowl.  It begins to thaw pretty quickly, especially in hot weather.  And that's when ice cream is best, isn't it?  And finally, twenty-five minutes to half an hour is about as long as the freezer bowl lasts, so if you've gone that long and it's still looking like soft-serve, get it right into a container and toss it in the freezer for a while before serving.I know it sounds complicated, but it's not really.  Most of it is just remembering to get things to the right temperature.  This isn't a big, fancy freezing unit, it's a relatively inexpensive way to make your own ice cream at home.  You're going to have to make some adjustments.  That said, I have to tell you that it's a great deal of fun to watch the ice cream freezing and to turn it out into bowls and see the eyes of your family light up when you say, &quot;The ice cream is ready!&quot;I put this item in the fun to have but not a necessity category.", "summary": "Recommended with a reservation or two", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
