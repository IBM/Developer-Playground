So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan wasn't included in kit like the first 2 kits were. This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you, no pun intended. But this definitely isn't for a beginner.", "summary": "Good Lesson Plan", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
