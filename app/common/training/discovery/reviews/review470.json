Though less expensive, they are less consistant.The Cuisinart ice cream maker is the opposite.  This handy contraption soft freezes your ingredients in a mere 20 - 30 minutes and is simple to use.  Simply freeze the canister ahead of time, add frozen canister to top of plastic base, add ingredients and turn on!Consistant results every time.  The recipe book included with the machine is very good, and all of the recipes are easy to follow and are delicious. Some recipes are no cook Philadelphia Style (only cream, sugar and flavorings) though most are custard style (involving cooking the ingredients and adding eggs).  All are easy to make even by the kitchen novice.Once you learn the basics of making ice cream, you will not want to buy store bought again.I use this machine about once a week to make ice creams, sherberts, and water ices.  Its definately a must for those who like fresh homemade desserts.", "summary": "Throw away the ice and salt.
