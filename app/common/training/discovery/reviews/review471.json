Since I own a chest freezer I use it to store the bowl and have avoided the problem some mentioned concerning the ice cream not freezing well. I must say I love this appliance! It works exactly as advertised and I have been enjoying some of the best ice cream in my life. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to purchase an ice cream maker.", "summary": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
