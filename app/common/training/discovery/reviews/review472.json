Two of the openings in this Y were the right size, but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it, but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency.", "summary": "Some other fittings may not work with this fitting", "product_name": "Woodstock W1015 4-Inch Y-Fitting", "product_id": "B0000223YC"}
