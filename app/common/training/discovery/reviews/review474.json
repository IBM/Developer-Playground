It's a great little machine...I don't think it's that noisy (no more so than a food processor).  I love it - I do agree that the recipes that come with it are not great, but there are lots of wonderful recipes out there.  This is fast, easy, and no worries about salt and ice running all over make it much more likely I will continue to use it quite often!", "summary": "The girls from Thomasville", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
