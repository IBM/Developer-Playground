It costs more to make ice cream at home than if you buy Hagan-Daaz in the store.  But, if you really like to make your own concoction, than this is really great.  Also, sorbet is super cheap to make with this unit (especially fantastic when berries are in season)...And, if you like a daiquiri or margarita..;) [no point in adding vodka because, of course, it doesn't freeze]).  I made a killer peach sorbet!The booklet also says that it can make yogurt, but, I haven't tried that yet...I may in the future though.The ice cream maker is a bit large, so, it's not really a regular counter-top item.  Also, the insert will take up some room in your freezer and takes time to ice up.  Additionally, you will need to freeze the stainless steel insert in your freezer for at least 6 hours before making a batch.If you really like homemade ice cream, sorbets, margaritas, and yogurt, than you will have a lot of fun with this this unit.Also, comes with some recipe booklet with a some other paperwork.Have fun!", "summary": "Great Sorbet", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
