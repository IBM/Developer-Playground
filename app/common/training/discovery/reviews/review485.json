Some nice features like the reverse function to use as an exhaust fan, but definitely not worth the money. In reading other reviews a number of people have mentioned this as a &#34;whole house&#34; fan. They must live in a trailer because this doesn't even circulate enough air to make much of a difference in my 400sqft living room.", "summary": "Poor", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
