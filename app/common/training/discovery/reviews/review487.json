Unfortunately, then, not only is my kid playing with an electrical outlet, but I've lost the red and green tabs critical for the function of this device.

I'll stick to timers without removable small parts from now on.", "summary": "Avoid if you have small kids", "product_name": "Intermatic TN311C 120 Volt Heavy Duty Grounded Timer", "product_id": "B00002N5FO"}
