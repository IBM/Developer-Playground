The book does what it's intended to do. However it came all folded up the packing was real bad the book is folded vertically and horizontally!!!! I bought it because the store I go to was out of it. It came in 24 hours so I was grateful for that. Again the packing was BAD!", "summary": "ok", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
