It is easy to assemble, sturdy, and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future. My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed. This design, on the other hand, is much more simplistic, which is a very good thing. It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage), and is a preferable design.", "summary": "Great, sturdy, basic pressure cooker.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
