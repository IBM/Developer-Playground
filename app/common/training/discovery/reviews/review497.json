I loved my first one and used it several times a week, but I didn't add enough water once, scorched the heck out of it, and it was never the same. I tried all the thrifty tricks to get out scorched ick but it didn't work. However, I liked and used this one so much I bought another one exactly like my first.I have a Russel Hobbes electric pressure cooker that is larger and really nice for food that cooks longer because I can set it and walk away. However, it's big and bulky. My Presto is my go too pressure cooker for potatoes, makes great cheesecake, I love pressure cooking squash, carrots etc. The construction is heavy and seems well made.", "summary": "Nice and inexpensive", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
