I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker, hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use, just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean, as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!", "summary": "Much better then I had ever thought...", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
