I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto.", "summary": "Pressure Cooker", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
