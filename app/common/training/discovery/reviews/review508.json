It was great for camping, for we could make New England Boil Dinner.  My wife has our old one at the shore, and we use it a lot.  However, many of the family are not there but in our villa 100 miles away, and we like many meals that we us the Presto pressure cooker.  Now, I can make the dinners here, and we thing they are the best pressure cookers around.  It is great time saver.", "summary": "Great way to cook food", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
