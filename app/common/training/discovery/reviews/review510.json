I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver, resulting in great tasting food!", "summary": "Well Built, Works great", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
