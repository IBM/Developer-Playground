We used one of the recipes printed in the user's manual, Herbed Chicken. The recipe calls for basil, celery, oregano, parsley, onions, and garlic, along with other readily available ingredients. Total time for the meal to be ready from food preparation, to the pressure cooker building up to pressure, with the actual cooking time was about 15 minutes.The Herbed Chicken was absolutely delicious. We can't wait to try another recipe. We also ordered 2 pressure cooker cookbooks. It really is satifying to own a fine and affordable cooking appliance such as this one in which we can cook delicious, nutritious meals that are prepared within 15 minutes. It was not difficult to use, and clean up was effortless and fast. We did read the user's manual carefully since this was our first time with one.The price was very reasonable, and this pressure cooker has a 12 year warranty (according to the user's manual). Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery service, and thanks Presto for the fine pressure cooker. We look forward to using it on a weekly basis.", "summary": "Herbed Chicken Was Absolutely Delicious", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
