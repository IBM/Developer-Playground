Every now and then, it releases the steam so no pressure can build up.  If I jiggle it, to get it to set, it generally falls down into the kettle.  At that point, I have to remove the lid, and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli, but more of a problem if it's bean soup.  I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time, but with my old one (not nearly as good, overall) I never had to think about it.
