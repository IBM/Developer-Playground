I have no such entertaining stories, just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher, no fuss, no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel, putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood.", "summary": "bygone cooking", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
