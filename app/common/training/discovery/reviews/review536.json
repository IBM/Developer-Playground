The Presto works decently, but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop, catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid, the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height, the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top, but not the sides.", "summary": "Decent, second rate product", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
