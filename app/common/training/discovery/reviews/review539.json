Now I wish I'd have ordered the 6-quart.Even though it's stainless, it's very lightweight.  This is handy as I have permanent chest pain after surgery, so lifting can be difficult.It works fine.  It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours.  Similarly, I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast.  I haven't tried grains yet as I was on a risotto kick when this arrived, and then went on a temporary grain-free diet.I am quite satisfied, except I wish I'd gotten the larger one.", "summary": "should've got the 6-quart one", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
