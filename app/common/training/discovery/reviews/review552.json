When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep, that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less, takes up less room in my cupboard, and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!", "summary": "I LOVE PRESSURE COOKERS", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
