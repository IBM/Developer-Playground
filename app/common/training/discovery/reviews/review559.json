Good things are its not too big, the lid goes on real smooth, the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go, when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move, lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of.", "summary": "nice basic cooker but the handles a kind of cheap", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
