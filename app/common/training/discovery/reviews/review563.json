Presto Pressure Cookers have been used in my family for many many years.  I have to admit that I was a bit afraid of them due to some urban legends being passed around, but I decided to try this one.  It is amazing.  After the first use, I was totally sold!!!  It is easy to use and the directions are very clear and easy to understand.  This one is foolproof and safe.", "summary": "Love this Pressure Cooker", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
