This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First, I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next, I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial, yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last, this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one, but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again.", "summary": "Does the job well", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
