For example, to cook potatoes the time is given as 8 minutes, but it takes 10 minutes to build up the full pressure before you're to start timing, so it's really 18 minutes.  Plan accordingly.  It's even worse for recipes done in parts where you cool it down to add a second step or things that would over cook if added at the beginning - then you have to build to pressure twice.The cooking rack at the botton is nice, but no easy way to extract it when it's hot, or thicken gravy, so you have to empty it, reclaim the juice, thicken that, and add back the main dish and stir on low heat.Since you can't fill the thing more than half way or three fourths to the top (for safety) I sort of wish I got the 8 quart one so a entire cut up chicken and vegetables wouldn't be pushing the limit.Still, it's easy to clean up and use.", "summary": "\"Cooking Times\" may be a bit deceptive.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
