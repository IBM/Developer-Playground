The handle itself is curved to fit against the pot, but the directions emphasize multiple times that you shouldn't overtighten to avoid cracking the plastic.  I tightened it reasonably and when the pot is full and it's tilted to pour out the contents (boiling water for example), the handle wobbles/turns slightly.  I can easily see this becoming a hazard with continued use/failure to retighten regularly.  Fortunately, Amazon was willing to accept the return.  The company could resolve this problem by using metal on the edge of the handle piece, selling their pots pre-assembled in a more sturdy manner, or hey- bright idea- USING TWO FASTENERS LIKE EVERY OTHER POT MANUFACTURER.
