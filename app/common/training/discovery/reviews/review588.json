It is exactly as described, four quart. I wanted a smaller pot for making smaller batches.  It works perfectly.  I like the heavy gauge body.  The seal feels very secure.  The only thing that is a bit flimsy is the pressure regulator.  I will see how it holds up.", "summary": "I like it!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
