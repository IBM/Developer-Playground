I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well, time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work, I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home, I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!", "summary": "A great addition to your kitchen", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
