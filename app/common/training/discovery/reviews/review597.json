It really does work, and makes yum-yum foods quickly, when one doesn't have the time to spend 3 hours making foods.  I'm impressed by the quality of the stainless steel, particularly the bottom, which is pretty thick.  I don't see any downsides to owning one.", "summary": "Perfect for fast cooking", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
