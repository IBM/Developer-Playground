It works perfect on my Induction Cooker.  This is my second Presto Pressure cooker, the first one had wooden handles, and was made of aluminum (still in service).  Aluminum not being compatible with Induction Cooking I got the Stainless Steel.  The encapsulated bottom creates that perfect heat distribution for searing and browning.  What an absolutely beautiful combination.  The new sealing ring is a wonder all by its self when compared to the ones of the 1940's.  Do I sound happy with this cooker, That's because I am.  The first thing I cooked was a pot of Pinto beans,(see photo) the pressure cooker cooked them 14 times faster than a conventional pan.  Clean up is a breeze, and to keep that just out of the box look I use Bar Keepers Friend. During assembling, use caution when attaching the handle to the lid as I twisted off one of the screws, which is not a problem or deterrent as Presto has great customer service, and sent a complete new replacement assembly.  I shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future.  Thanks to Amazon.com for a fantastic buy.  All Pros and No Cons.  This review was written assuming the reader knows a little bit about Pressure Cooking.  Pressure Cooking is Fast, Fun, and Flavorful.  :)", "summary": "Perfect Bang For The Buck", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
