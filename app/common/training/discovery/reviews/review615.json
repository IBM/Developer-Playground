The bottom is triple clad, and heavy-duty.  It is 'induction' ready, too, for those who cook by this method.  This pressure cooker is well worth the money and works well, cleans up well, and can accomodate the same stainless trivet and \"little pan\" that goes into the 8-qt stainless pressure cooker (which I bought before I got this 6-qt one.)", "summary": "Great product, works well, heavy-duty triple-clad bottom, induction ready, too.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
