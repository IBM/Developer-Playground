I finally boiled something dry in it and it warped the bottom to the point that I couldn't use it any more.  I decided to upgrade to a stainless version because aluminum may or may not be good to cook in depending on who you ask.  This pot is considerably thinner than the aluminum one which I chalk up to steel being more durable, but the big problem with this one is that the handle on the lid doesn't line up with the handle on the pot.  It ends up being slightly to the left so then I have to back it off a little so that the safety knob will pop up to lock the lid.  It doesn't feel unsafe and it cooks well, but it is annoying and feels cheap.  I guess I'm stuck with this one but I won't be buying another one online if I can help it.  I'll be opening the box in the store and making sure the lid works first next time.", "summary": "Meh.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
