The worst thing about it is that you have to attatch the handle to the lid. It's hard to do and it loosens every time you use it so your constantly tightening it. I wish it had been factory assembled instead of my having to assemble it . I don't have the hand strength go do it right.", "summary": "additional assembly required", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
