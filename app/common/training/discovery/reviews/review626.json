The pot comes up to pressure quickly.  It could use an improved booklet that is better organized (I end up using my old booklet most of the time) but the pot is good for cooking in general as well as the pressure cooking aspect. It works on my induction cooktop well also.", "summary": "Great quality product", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
