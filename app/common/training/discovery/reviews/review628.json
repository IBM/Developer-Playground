This is a great pressure cooker and the size of 4 Quarts is ideal for me.  I made beef stew (cuban style) which is stew beef and potatoes with olives.  It came great and this 4 Quarts is big enough  for this recipe, with gravy and everything.  I was right by purchasing this Presto.  This is a great product for its quality and price.  Extremely happy with this purchase.  Highly recommended.", "summary": "Excellent pressure cooker, and beautiful too.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
