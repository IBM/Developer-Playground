As window fans go this is one of the better plastic ones. It disassembles easily to clean. The design is a bit flawed, you have to tape over holes and cracks with white tape to get maximum suction and block air from coming back in. The right sized blinds will close nicely on top and block the crack if you mount it for the window to close and open.", "summary": "Ok for the Price", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
