I ordered 2 of these 16\" fans and boy are they big! They work incredibly well. I use one as an intake (High pressure area) and the other as an exhaust (Low pressure area). I can also turn both fans to exhaust and my whole house is clear as a bell, smells fresh, not a wisp of smoke anywhere, in only 2 minutes. 2 minutes! I had spent almost $1,000 for 2 Ionic Breeze Quadras and they couldn't do in hours what these 2 fans did for $130 in 2 minutes! These fans are a godsend! I actually could have easily gotten by with 2 of the 9\" fans instead. I'll probably order 2 of them to use for the winter/spring months then have these 16\" bad boys for the summer/fall months. I can imagine these fans would be heavenly for people with pets, cigar smokers, for cooking strong smelling foods like fish, etc. As you can see I am pleasantly surprised and very happy on my purchases. Also love the fact that the fans are both intake/exhaust. Great product, thank you.", "summary": "Excellent", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
