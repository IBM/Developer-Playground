I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets, is giant, and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off, the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it, but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market.", "summary": "Too big, loud, powerful, lets bugs through for my use", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
