I went for this 16\" and it does the job just as quietly as the 20\". Very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration. I only wish that the side extenders were metal like they are on the Air King. The grill on the front of the fan is metal. I am very happy with this purchase and that's why it gets FIVE STARS. These are both excellent, high quality fans and I would not hesitate to purchase again.", "summary": "Perfect for my 2BR condo", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
