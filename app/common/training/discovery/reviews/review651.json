This is what I so love about it: 1. Works like a dream. No rattles, shakes, quivers. Just a steady strong stream of wonderful air.  2.Well built.  It arrived in the military pouch system with the box a bit smashed, but not a single dent on the item.  3. It's light.  I can cart it room to room very easily.  Even though it's so light, it sits on the floor very stably.  4. The only sound it makes is the sound of air moving. no whine, no rattles, no vibrations.  5. No assembly required. None! 6. The design is compact, extreme care given to maximizing output for the footprint.  I'm impressed.", "summary": "This is a rave review - it's a fantastic product", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
