We use ours almost exclusively in our very large master bedroom on the high setting (we like the sound and the breeze).  Others mentioned that it's not all that powerful, but we find it plenty strong for indoor/casual use.  It's not an industrial shop fan by any means, but it's great for cooling a large room, painted walls, even outside on a deck.  It's very light for it's size and the tilting feature is nice.", "summary": "Great fan.", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
