Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but, I admit, a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps, my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book, as all Wilton Lesson Plans, it's great.", "summary": "Lots of Fun and Frustration!!!", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
