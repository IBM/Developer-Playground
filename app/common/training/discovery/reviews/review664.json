This fan wasn't up to the task.  We got a bigger fan by a Air King, and that got the air going.This fan is fine if you want to create a breeze or move the stale air out a large room.  Quiet operation is a big plus compared to the Air King.  So I'd recommend it for many purposes, but it wasn't what we needed.", "summary": "Ability to move air is limited", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
