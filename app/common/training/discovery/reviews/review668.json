In the evenings though the temperature can dip into the 60s.  So I though of venting out the heat and drawing in the cool air, at night and early morning. I installed this in one of the casement windows in my house.  The way I installed it allowed for the window to be closed without taking down this fan.  So at night, I turn this on and vent out the hot indoor air, and it creates a negative pressure in the house so it sucks air through my front door and windows of the other bedrooms. It does create a cool breeze as it is drawing in the cooler fresh air.  I have not turned on my Air Conditioner since I installed this.During the day, I turn this off and shut the window and leave a small crack just to have some air.  The indoor temperature does increase by about 5 degrees by dusk.  When the Outdoor temperature goes below the indoor temperature, I open all the windows and doors and turn on this exhaust fan.  This system works very well for us and I am very happy with this purchase since I am saving so much money.  This paid for itself after only 2 weeks. You have to love that.", "summary": "Efficient home cooling", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
