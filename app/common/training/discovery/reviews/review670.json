We turn it on &#34;reverse&#34; in the evening, drawing the cool air into our hot bedroom and it cools down the room a solid 10 degrees almost immediately.2. We leave it on all night in the reverse setting and it's completely changed our sleep pattern for the better. It keeps our room cool and drones out the loud road noise.3. I love having the option of having the window open still with the fan off and a soft breeze.4. The unit is not very attractive so we have a cafe curtain in front of it. When we turn it on, the curtain just blows upward and is not in the way.5. Install it on a window with a screen. We originally tried a different room, an old double hung window with no screen, and we woke up to a flying insect massacre on the floor. They were sucked in and didn't have a chance.", "summary": "We can finally sleep!", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
