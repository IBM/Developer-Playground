This seems to have done the job,  I used it this past hot summer (2012) as an exhaust fan to move air in the house and to get it cooled off in the evening.  This machine seems to have done it, quietly...quieter that I thought it would be.  It is a two-directional fan, so you can bring air in or pull it out.  It also has 3 speeds, I used the medium speed all summer, 24/7.  No problems to report, would buy another.  I don't have AC here so this was it, and it stood the test.
