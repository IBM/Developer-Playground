It'll cool off my whole downstairs.  I use it more than air conditioning when it's hot.  Saves on the electric bill.  I also have a smaller one in my bedroom and run that at night in the hot summers and it cools off our room better than air conditioning.  Good fan for drawing in the cool night air.", "summary": "Lasko Reversible Window Fan", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
