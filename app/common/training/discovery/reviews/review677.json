I had a Lasko reversible window fan that my sister gave me used, and that fan carried me thru some hot days for 6-7 years. I searched and found 3 fans and compared prices and wow-Amazon had the best price. I would recommend this fan to anyone who needs a great reversible window fan. I love it !", "summary": "SUMMERTIME", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
