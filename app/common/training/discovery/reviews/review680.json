It had their name on it, but it was obviously built by Lasko. That original is still functional, but after 14 years, it was time for a new one. Must be a proven, solid design to have been in production this long. It moves the air through my home easily, but my house is smallish, only about 1500 square ft. My only gripe concerns the fan guard, or grill, which faces towards the outside, through the open window. This grill is plastic, which we all know doesn't last forever. Exposed to direct sunlight and the elements, this grill will eventually become brittle. It takes several years for that to happen, but that's what happened with the first fan.I hope that Lasko will in the future consider making this grill out of metal, like the one facing the inside.One last thing........if, like me, you're sick of seeing \"Made in China\" stamped on everything, this fan is American-made.", "summary": "Good, solid performer.", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
