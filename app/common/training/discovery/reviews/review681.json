My office area, in the corner of a very large room, is extremely cold all year round.  I have been getting by with a small DeLonghi Safeheat, but wanted something taller to provide heat to my upper body.  I also suffer from hot flashes so I needed something that oscillated.I didn't read any reviews here first.  Just went by my co-worker's glowing praise for hers.  She does sit in an office and I don't.  However, the features seemed to fit my bill.I am quite happy with the heater.  I appreciate the different heat and fan settings.  The oscillation works as I'd hoped - not concentrating the heat right on me.  It keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows.  It is very nice to have a remote so I'm not jumping up and down to change the settings.  I bought it knowing that it would never really heat my area up to the temperatures given.  I just need my area warm enough to work in without a coat.There are only two drawbacks for me so far: the heater vents are about 5 or 6 inches up off the floor so the heat doesn't keep my feet warm.  I have to use the small one for my feet.  The second problem is the beep!  I can understand fully how this would be a problem in a bedroom.  It would wake me up!The light doesn't bother me since I only use it during the day.  I understand people's problem with them in the bedroom, though.  Between my Powerbook and the TV boxes, I swear my bedroom has more small lights than some Xmas trees!  I wish more engineers were aware of the studies on blinking lights and the concept of atavistic threat movement.  [g]For me, the heater only misses a score of 5 due to the annoying beep sound.", "summary": "I recommend this heater", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
