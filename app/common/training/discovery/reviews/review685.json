It fits where and how I want it to go and will do the job.It's got some sharp plastic edges on the inside. Sliced a finger reaching in to slide the side panels to fit.Low and medium speeds don't move much air and the small motor whines a bit on high. Fortunately I don't have to be in the room with it when it's on high.It does a much better job than the Holmes dual window fan I was using but I do long for the old metal King Air 20\" I had years ago. That was a window fan.", "summary": "Probably the best available today, but,", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
