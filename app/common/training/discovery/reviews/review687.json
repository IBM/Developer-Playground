I cook stew meat in 25 to 30 mins, pot roast in 50 mins, veggies in 5 mins after it gets up to temp. Trick is to have only the small recommended amount of water.I've had the 6 qt stainless for 18 years and need to replace the rubber seal and plug every 7 years or so. I use mine a lot, 3 times a week ($7 for both at AMZ) which is why I am here commenting. Don't get the aluminum ones, not good for you.Very safe and fool proof. You can't open it until it stops steaming.Tales about dangerous come from Grandmas who were cooking in the 1930's, 40 and early 50's before safety features.Buy into their recipes not their tales.", "summary": "Safe , Sturdy and Stainless", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
