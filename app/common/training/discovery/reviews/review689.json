The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected, streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.  I did all these things, to no avail.So I returned it.  Now I'm going to try Presto.", "summary": "Cooks Great-Pressure Problem", "product_name": "Mirro 92180A Polished Aluminum 10-PSI Pressure Cooker Cookware, 8-Quart, Silver", "product_id": "B00002N5ZP"}
