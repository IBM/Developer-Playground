To give you an idea how good this fan works, do you know those 20\" box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks, well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20\" box fan on high. No kidding. I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan. Don't hesitate, buy it.", "summary": "Really nice.", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
