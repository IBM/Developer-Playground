We had one of these, which was a little smaller, and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously, with that much power, you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer, I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs!
