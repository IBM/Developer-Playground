I like noise when I sleep at night and that was the primary function of this fan.....although it was so quiet that I needed to use it on medium or high to get the noise I wanted.  Good fan though and I will likely replace my dead one with another one just like it.  I'm surprised they still make this one and sell it.", "summary": "Many years of service", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
