I have especially appreciated this fan in our immediate 100 plus temps.  We use a heat pump which looses effectiveness past the ground level.  I place this fan over the top of the floor vent in the kitchen and it sucks up and sweeps the slower trickle of cooler air and spews it out quite well!Love this FAN!", "summary": "Wind!", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
