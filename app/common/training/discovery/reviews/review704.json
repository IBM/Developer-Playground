The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and won't hold on. We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4\" hex bolt. It held for a year. Now the handle has fallen off, again. Is the bolt the problem? No, it's the threaded receptacle! MAYBE, if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread #10 bolt in.If This doesn't work, I'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked, it did well. A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope, this cooker is useless.
