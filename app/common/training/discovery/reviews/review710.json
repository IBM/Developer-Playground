I have fond memories of this 'ricer', a favorite kitchen implement of my Dad's. I still have an old pestle from the old days.  The design is a little different from the ones of my childhood, but I think this design appeals to me more.  I love 'riced' potatoes and anticipate using this 'food press' to make tomato purees and finish other fruit. I'm just excited to have it.", "summary": "The 'Ricer' of my memories", "product_name": "Mirro 9605000A Canning Accessories Food Press with Wooden Pestle Cookware, Silver", "product_id": "B00002N5ZQ"}
