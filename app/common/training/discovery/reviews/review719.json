The Teflon coating was chipping off, and because of safety concerns, I was happy to receive another pressure cooker as a gift. That cooker (the Casa Essentials 5-quart model) only lasted for a few uses. The silicone seal ring lost its ability to form a seal, and the part cost almost as much as the cooker. I decided to upgrade and bought the Presto 4-quart cooker.Within a few uses, the handle became loose, because the screws that hold it on are too small. Every time I use the cooker, I tighten the handle. Next, the safety seal in the lid started seating improperly and allowing steam to escape. So as the pot heats up, I tap on the safety seal to seat it properly.Today when I tapped, the safety seal fell down into the chicken soup, which began spraying out of the hole and all over the kitchen. Not a pleasant event on a morning when I felt a bit under the weather and was looking forward to a bowl of chicken soup for lunch.I fished out the rubber seal and put the soup in a conventional pan to finish cooking. Because of the problem with the handles, I'm not going to replace the seal. I will discard the pan and either buy a good quality pressure cooker or do without one.", "summary": "Cheap pressure cooker didn't last", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
