I looked everywhere for the smallest size, they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook.", "summary": "Love it!", "product_name": "Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N601"}
