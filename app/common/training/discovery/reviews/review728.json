Growing up, my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine, but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal, and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item.", "summary": "Not a great product.", "product_name": "Mirro 9605000A Canning Accessories Food Press with Wooden Pestle Cookware, Silver", "product_id": "B00002N5ZQ"}
