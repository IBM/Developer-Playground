As the name says this beast is a WIND machine, it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1, a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2, and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep.", "summary": "Great White Noise Generator", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
