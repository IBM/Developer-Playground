It was a great unit and we hated to have to replace it. This new one works just as well as the old one did when it was new. You can pay a lot more for a pressure cooker but I don't see how it would work any better.", "summary": "Presto 4 Quart Pressure Cooker", "product_name": "Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N601"}
