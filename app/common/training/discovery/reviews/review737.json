The rubber gasket and stopper can't go in the dishwasher but the other parts can.  I use this to make beans about twice a week and it produces a result much better than when I was boiling them before.This is also pretty big - would recommend looking at an equivalent sized vessel in person before purchasing.  I also like that's it's stainless steel as opposed to aluminum.", "summary": "Pressure Cooker", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
