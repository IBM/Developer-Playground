She says she really likes it.  It is nice looking and has the same footprint as the 4 qt. cooker (which is nice in a small kitchen).  She brought some beans she made in it to a cookout, and they were delicious.  I think it is a good value for the price.", "summary": "A Gift -- Recipient Loved It", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
