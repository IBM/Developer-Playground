My mother instilled so much fear in me about using a pressure cooker that I didn't even want to try it until a friend finally convinced me.  Now I'd absolutely hate to be without this fast and safe way to cook.My first experiment was a recipe for Chicken Cacciatore.  Three pounds of chicken cooked for 10 minutes (at 6000' altitude) and was fork-tender and delicious.  My next endeavor was a ham and bean soup, which cooked for 35 minutes without having to presoak the beans, and it turned out perfectly. Beans were completely cooked but not mushy.  Next came a pot roast with potatoes, which cooked for 45 minutes starting partially frozen, and was perfect.  Then tried a chicken with plum sauce--again a nine-minute success.  Most recently we tried pasta with meat sauce, which was a delicious one-pot meal ready in 7 minutes cooking time.I love this Presto model cooker, because it has all the safety features, but still allows careful monitoring of the\"jiggle top\", and allows me to judge how fast the dish is cooking. This is a heavy and well-built unit. The safety precautions are easy, and are fully described in the accompanying manual.I also recommmend Lorna Sass' book \"Pressure Perfect\", for beginners.  This book is a well-written primer on pressure cooking, with recipes that are reliable and carefully written.  The recipes have a degree of creativity, but are all things that \"real people\" eat.Happy cooking!", "summary": "What a Wonderful Addition to my Kitchen!!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
