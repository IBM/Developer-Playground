I've never owned or used a pressure cooker and was a bit nervous when I fired it up for the 1st time. It heat up real quick using a ceramic glass cook top, and I was to able to brown the meat realitively quick. The contruction of this pressure cooker looks very high quality and well made. The only thing I wanna add is be very careful with when to lower the heat and when to move the steam controlling top on the top. You can lower the heat as soon as you see steam coming out of the bottom of steam controlling top, and be very careful not to touch the top until the nipple on the handle drops down, indicating that there's no pressure in the cooker. Good investment!", "summary": "Super Easy to Use!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
