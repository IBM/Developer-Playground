My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet), the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that, unlike my 8 qt., this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve, so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the \"jiggler\" steam valve is reminiscent of much older models, Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority.", "summary": "Terrific, practical pressure cooker", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
