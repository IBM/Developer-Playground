You can actually see it pick up the carpet.  Just be careful not to get anything (throw rug fringe, shoe laces, etc.) caught in it.I would give it a 5-Star rating except for the plastic handle.  It feels flimsy.  You'll probably need to replace the handle before the motor gives out.Overall, I'm glad I bought it.", "summary": "It Really Works !", "product_name": "Eureka Boss Upright Vacuum, 1934B - Corded", "product_id": "B00002N630"}
