I needed a sturdy, no-frills, bagged vacuum like the Montgomery Ward upright I used for over 20 years before it died.This model was almost identical, and now that I've had it for a few weeks, I'm happy as a clam.  It has an old-fashioned rotating brush/beater roller, 5 carpet height adjustments, great suction for 5 amps, and comes pre-fitted with a humongous disposable liner bag (type F&G;), plus a spare belt for the roller.  Some parts that used to be steel have been replaced with thick plastic, but it seems plenty sturdy, and it's much lighter to maneuver and carry than my old all-steel model.  The on/off button and lock/unlock for the handle are both on the base, so they're foot controls; carpet height is adjusted by a dial on the front of the base.  The long cord (20 feet or so) doesn't retract, you just wind it over hooks on the handle.  The spring-attached fabric bag has a full-length zipper, inside which the disposable bag (which fills the cover from end to end) slides on with another spring.  Quick, simple.One pass with this puppy picked up enough carpet fluff missed by the bagless to knit a throw rug, but there's still plenty of room left for future dirt.  It's also a lot less noisy than my smaller bagless.  The only qualm I had in buying this was the lack of attachments for cleaning upholstery & suchlike, but I found an inexpensive accessory kit made for it (crevice tool, round dust brush, upholstery brush, extension tubes, looooong flexible hose) right here on Amazon:  the \"Electrolux Home Care 60E 6-Piece Deluxe Tool Set,\"  so my joy is complete.Though the image on this page looks rather green, the vacuum is actually jet black, and the bag is a black-white-red random print.  It comes in a flat box, minor assembly required.  Highly recommended for those who remember how good the old vacuums were, don't want to spend a fortune just to clean their carpets, or are into retro styling.", "summary": "A time-tested winner", "product_name": "Eureka Boss Upright Vacuum, 1934B - Corded", "product_id": "B00002N630"}
