It is the perfect size for my 2 person household. Many empty nesters and those with small kitchens will find this a terrific product.The accessories make this pot multifunctional and expand its usefulness. There is :- a steamer basket- a glass lid- a strainer lid - which locks in place like the pressure cooking lid for draining hot liquid from pasta, veggies,etc. The locking capability of the strainer lid makes draining hot liqiuds very easy and safe.There are many books available for those unfamiliar to pressure cooking such asPressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand many others. The options are unlimited and so you are not stuck with only pot roast or stew. You can even bake  cheesecake in the pressure cooker. Pick a book and get started!The Presto website is another great resource with lots of recipes and tips.This cooker saves time, conserves energy (propane in my case), and prevents loss of nutrients in food while giving delicious results.Do not let the stories of pressure cookers exploding from way back when frighten you.  The newer cookers have safety features to prevent this.The Presto brand is very common across the country so the parts are widely available.The sealing ring must be replaced on all pressure cookers  periodically no matter who the manufacturer is. Many hardware stores (mom and pop as well as large chains) carry thePresto Pressure Cooker Sealing Ring/Overpressure Plug Pack (4 & 6 Quart). An important  consideration to make before purchase.", "summary": "Perfect Pressure Cooker & Multifunctional Pot", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
