It was purchased September 8, 2009.Currently, my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt. The bag in the back was emptied so we know that's not the problem. Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what's wrong with it, and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time hasn't been that great. It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start, and I can't say I was overly impressed on carpet. It's clunky to move around, and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over.", "summary": "Its been a year!", "product_name": "Eureka Boss Upright Vacuum, 1934B - Corded", "product_id": "B00002N630"}
