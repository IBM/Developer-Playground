No matter what I try, Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.  The ergonomics are perfect, but the singularly winning aspect of this machine is it's strong suction and firm grabbing power as you pull it back toward yourself. It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble, re-arrange, clean or empty trays, reassemble, etc.  I just tap the 'On' button, release the handle and go.  I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go.", "summary": "Simply the Best", "product_name": "Eureka Boss Upright Vacuum, 1934B - Corded", "product_id": "B00002N630"}
