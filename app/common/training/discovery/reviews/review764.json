For this price, it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much.  It is especially useful for vegetarians.  Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it.  As long as it is under pressure, you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product, it is overly large for my needs.  If you just plan on cooking a cup or two of beans at a time, I would recommend getting the 4 qt version of this product.  Because the pressure cooker is so fast, there's really no need to make large batches of things.", "summary": "Great product but would buy the smaller version", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
