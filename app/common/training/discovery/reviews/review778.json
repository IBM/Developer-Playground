Used in an apartment with wooden floor. The $ (dollar) value of the vacuuming power is awesome. It is a great advantage to not have additional attachments that will take away from the main vacuum. At the value of this vacuum, one can afford an independent and highly effective smaller hand-vac if hose attachments are desired.", "summary": "Great product and value", "product_name": "Eureka Boss Upright Vacuum, 1934B - Corded", "product_id": "B00002N630"}
