Bliss to Iraq and so far it has held up 10X better then those flimsy foot lockers that they sell at the exchange. definately worth every penny. Still locked, still in one piece, lid still closes. Looks great, and everything inside is in one piece. wouldn't trade it for the world. May even buy some more!", "summary": "Iraq bound", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
