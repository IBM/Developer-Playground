Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now, you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall, very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split, so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes, the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still, it's a decent box that continues to function okay.", "summary": "Very sturdy and secure.
