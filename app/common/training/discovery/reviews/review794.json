Ive kept it ever since... Its lasted through highschool, going to summer camp, it went to college with me (I used it as extra seating and as a bed a couple of times). It made it through moving 3 times after college and the only reason it didnt deploy with me (much better than Army Toughboxes) is that it didnt have wheels. its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it. I love this thing!", "summary": "well worth every penny", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
