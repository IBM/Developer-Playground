This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course, I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that, but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is, I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it, I recommend you get the \"cable\" style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible, but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable.", "summary": "Excellent storage box", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
