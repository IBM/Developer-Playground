The 48-gallon and the 32-gallon boxes fit perfectly side-by-side on the carrier. We expected the boxes to be rain-proof and waterproof, and they do not disappoint.  We have driven thru heavy rain with driving wind with these babies, and everything inside was a dry as could be - not a drop of moisture inside.  We leave them outside when we camp, through some severe thunderstorms and still no rain gets in.  They fit our purpose perfectly.We did not purchase the cargo boxes from Amazon; our local Wal-Mart had much better pricing in the automotive department.If you want to add wheels, the 48-gallon model has drill-out spots for attaching casters.  Personally, I don't want to do that because I want to keep the integrity of the water tight properties intact, and I don't want wheels on the cargo carrier.  But it is certainly an option for those who want it, and looks pretty easy to accomplish.So why 4 stars instead of 5? The handles. I wish that the handles were deeper or perhaps had folding handles.  The boxes are difficult to carry when heavily packed. I might try to drill out holes to add rope handles, but that water tight issue has stopped me so far. Other than that one detail, these cargo boxes are perfect for us.", "summary": "Rain-proof storage solution", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
