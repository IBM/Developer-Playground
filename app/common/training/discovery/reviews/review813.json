I use it on my 650cc atv to carry a multitude of items,  I did add some D rings to hold tie downs to hole items from bouncing around,  this works very well and keeps items in their place,  it has been used in various weather conditions and suffered no leaks, everything stays dry and in place now", "summary": "cargo box", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
