I've owned it for almost four years now and over that time have used it to do everything from make homemade nut butters to rough chop vegetables to make my own oat flour out of oatmeal.  It has performed very well at all of these tasks and years later, still has lots of power and cleans up beautifully.  It is fantastic and I could not say enough wonderful things about it.That said, I do have a couple of caveats.  The first is that I would never buy it as a primary food processor.  It is just too small for normal tasks.  Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor.  Using it in an application like this would take forever.  However, it's great for doing basic chopping tasks because it is so easy and light to pull out onto the counter and efficient.  I also love how the stainless steel look coordinates with my appliances and other gadgets.  Overall it is a great product and if it ever dies I am likely to replace it with another Cuisinart.", "summary": "Great for small tasks", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
