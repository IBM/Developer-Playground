She's at the age where putting things in to boxes and taking them out can occupy her for some time.  She loves putting little treasures in here and taking them all over the place.  The size of the box is like that of a metal lunch box.  Big enough for a toddler.  We haven't had any problems with it and it is quite durable for a play date.", "summary": "Toddler daughter loves it!", "product_name": "Curious George Tin Keepsake Box with Latch by Schylling", "product_id": "B00000DMDJ"}
