Now, do it chop. Yep, it do a mighty fine job and with very little effort! Sliced 1\" thick and quartered a nice size purple union. Zap, zap, zap with the neat lever and wa-la, fine chopped union with no juice. Took three sweet pickles and zap, zap, zap again and got finely chopped pickles with no juice, ya-hooo. Hummmm, gotta get out tha Gum-mbo pot now. Get to tha store and get some assorted goodies. Hey, it's File Gumbo time and I'm gonna be \"King of tha Kitchen\" again. Now ladies, sorry!
