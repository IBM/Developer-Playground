Easy to use, easy to clean, and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints, except that the bowl feels kind of thin, like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl, but I guess only time will tell. Other than that, no complaints, and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up, and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it, but hindsight is 20/20.", "summary": "So far, so good!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
