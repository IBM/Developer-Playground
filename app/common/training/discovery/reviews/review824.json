She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition, but does well with her customary food.  I tried using a blender, but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.  We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA, which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.  I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the \"cheaper\" one.  I am impressed with its performance, ease of use and compact size.  It is clearly worth the small price I paid.  I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.  It is perfect for my intended use, and I can envision how to use it in cooking. I highly recommend it.", "summary": "Very Effective Mini Cuisinart", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
