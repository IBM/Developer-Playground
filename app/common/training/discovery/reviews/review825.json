We've used it to make small amounts of pesto or garlic sauce.  We've also used it to grind up fresh bread to make bread crumbs.  Given it's size, we had to feed it one slice at a time, but that was fine since the recipe did not require a lot.  So for small items, it's does a good job.We have noticed an electric burning smell if it's turned on for too long.  It's annoying, but not too bothersome.We have a 20 year old full size Cuisinart Food Processor that's still going strong.  Since Cuisinart is manufacturing their products in China these days, we've noticed that there is a big difference in the manufacturing and design quality of this little food processor compared to our old 20 year old full size model.  It does feel cheaper and that may explain the electric smell whent the food processor is used to much, the motor is being overtaxed.As long as you know it's limitations, it works well.", "summary": "Nice small food processor", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
