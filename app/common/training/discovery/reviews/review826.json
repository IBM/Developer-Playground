Although I trust the Cuisinart name, the fact that it was much less than similar mini-prep food processors left me hesitating (and honestly, screamed \"made in China by underpaid workers\").  I got over that (the first part; not super excited about the second) though, bought it, and LOVE IT.It handles everything I've given it easily and quickly.  Pesto, bread crumbs (including a batch of WAY overbaked croutons that were rock hard), spices, coffee beans, graham cracker crust (for a very tiny pie)... it's pleased me every time.My two favorite things: it comes with a little mini spatula, which allows you to get nearly every drop of whatever you're prepping out of the processor and into your recipe, which isn't always the case w/food processors - big or small.  Also, cleanup is a breeze- it rinses with a wipe (or top shelf dishwasher safe) and a quick wipe of the top of the base unit gets any \"dust\" from mixing right off- no crevices for stuff to get stuck (and get nasty).I love this little thing- so much that I bought one for my sister-in-law today!", "summary": "LOVE this kitchen \"gadget\" (SUPER easy cleanup)", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
