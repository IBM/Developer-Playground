I was looking for something to do the frequents small tasks of chopping nuts, onions, etc, that would be small enough to have a place out in public.  This is perfect.  It is about half the size of the Pro, and has a very elegant black chrome appearance and is about half the height of the Pro as well.It is lighter than the Pro in all aspects, but as with all my Cuisinart experiences, it does a great job on its intended tasks.  The warranty is the very odd number of 18 months, so you get the idea it's not supposed to be a workhorse.  But used as recommended, I'm sure mine will last \"forever\".  I've been looking for something like this for a long time, and considered Kitchenaid and other brands, as well as other Cuisinart models, and this one is exactly what I had hoped for.", "summary": "Perfect for what I wanted it", "product_name": "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRP"}
