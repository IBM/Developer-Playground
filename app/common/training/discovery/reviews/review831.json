I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series, but couldn't fit this one into my schedule, so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator, and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall, this is a great guide to decorating, but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything.", "summary": "Good if you've decorated before", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
