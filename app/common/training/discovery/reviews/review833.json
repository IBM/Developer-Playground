It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However, the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for \"cake decorating ideas\" when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly, if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it.", "summary": "Ok, but nothing super exciting", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
