Since all you see on the cover is some \"clown\" cupcakes using the silly-feet baking cups (which I also purchased) I was expecting more uses of the silly-feet (I counted five), but it really covers whimsical cupcakes of all sorts, many of which would be suitable to make with children (easy to make).It's really just an idea book and a catalog of Wilton products and what you can do with them. There is a helpful section called \"The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate\", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the \"it wasn't what I expected\" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If you are familiar with the typical adverbook that Wilton puts out, you shouldn't find any surprises here, and some of the recipes, which are a blend of from-a-mix and from-scratch, for the most part look very tempting.There are six pages of really cute Halloween cupcakes, including a vampire in a coffin, and some skeletons/ghosts/tombstones.", "summary": "Typical Wilton adverbook", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
