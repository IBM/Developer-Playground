It has sat out in broiling sun, freezing winter, pouring rain, and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available, and the new one looks just like the old one, but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!", "summary": "Same as it ever was - great!", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
