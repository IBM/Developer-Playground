However, I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book.", "summary": "Good for what it's worth", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
