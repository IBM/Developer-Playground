I promise your flowers will look SO real that it will surprise people. Each and every little hint that helps you to make your flowers appear real is in this book! You cannot go wrong with this book. You will find yourself reading it over and over, makign flowers over and over. You will see that your self-esteem will roar! People, co-workers, family members, friends will be dazzled and amazed -- and so will YOU.  This lesson book is extremely valuable. It cannot be purchased from Wilton (which is a real crying shame). I think Wilton is afraid that if they sell the book, they will miss out of selling classes, but not so.  I, myself, took 4 classes. Having bakes/cooked since the age of 9, I really didn't feel it was necessary but boy was I surprised. I learned more in my first class than I had in years of teaching. Wilton honestly needs to sell these lesson plans.  Not only will receive money from the classes, but they will also make money from the books.  Why would a company prefer their customers buy their books from someone else??? I've not figured that out.  Getting back to this lesson book...you will be extremely, extremely happy.  Your family will brag on you.  Your income will increase for making beautiful live-appearing flowers that you sell on your cakes. Please try it...you cannot fail!!! Best book ever on making and decorating flowers!!", "summary": "Wilton Flowers & Cake Design Lesson Plan", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
