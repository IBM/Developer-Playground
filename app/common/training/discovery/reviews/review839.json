I was amazed at all the ideas to do with a simple brownie!  Granted what I make won't ever look as good as the pictures in the book, but I'm okay with that.  If I had sat down and thought about it I might have come up with some of these same ideas, but some of them are really clever.  I have had fun looking through the book with my kids and we are making brownie pops for my son's b'day treats at school and his party.PROS:- You can buy most of these supplies (including the book) at Michael's Craft Supplies or Joann's and like I said, I saw the book at Target with some of the molds.- creative uses for brownies.  Great way to have an easy-to-make but fun treats for all sorts of occasions.- there are suggestions for b'day's, sports, holidays, gifts...CONS:- You need to buy the molds or supplies to make any of special shapes so it's an investment up front.  Once you have them it's all about Brownie Fun!I think this book is a great resource (or a fun gift!) for any parent or person who likes to bake and be creative.", "summary": "Great for kids or as a gift for a baker", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
