The book is full of color pictures so very well illustrated and the directions are clear and easy to follow. I also bought the class kit to go with it and it works great. would recommend for people wanting to learn how to do this on their own at home without a class.", "summary": "great book for beginners", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
