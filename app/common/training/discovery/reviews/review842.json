I have bought a few of these to carry birthday presents for my kids friends. They are good for lightweight use, and the Star Wars design is adorable. But as far as grocery store use / everyday use, they are not that strong of bags. TRU sells them around $3-4 each and they are just about as good enough for carrying light stuff and toys, but no heavy use or day to day use here.", "summary": "Cute design, but not good for long term use.", "product_name": "Vandor 52423 Star Wars Large Recycled Shopper Tote, Multicolored", "product_id": "1223070743"}
