It's huge! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse. It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it's so cheap. I am sure the intended purpose isn't for it to be used as a diaper bag daily but it works and I have gotten compliments on it even! It goes great with my Star Wars Vans too :D", "summary": "I love this bag.", "product_name": "Vandor 52423 Star Wars Large Recycled Shopper Tote, Multicolored", "product_id": "1223070743"}
