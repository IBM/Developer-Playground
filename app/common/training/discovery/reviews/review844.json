So, by association, I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.  What they did, however, was \"cheat\".  We had one of these - this same Franklin Spelling Corrector you see here (an older model but same nonetheless) and you each of us was allowed to use it to come up with all kinds of crazy words.  I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble, at first, but then I came to love it.  If you're all \"cheating\", then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.  We had a lot of fun.  Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).  I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!", "summary": "I use it for Scrabble games.", "product_name": "Franklin SPELLING CORRECTOR", "product_id": "1567120709"}
