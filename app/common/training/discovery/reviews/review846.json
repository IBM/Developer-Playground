It is ideal for smaller books and for those readers who don't need variety of reading angles. However, it can accommodate larger books as long as you are a bit careful how you use it. In addition to books, it works really well with a variety of electronic book readers and the new generation of tablet computers. I've used it with myKindle Wireless Reading Device (6\" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)and iPad. In fact, when I was looking for an inexpensive way of propping up my iPad so that it doesn't lay flat on the table I settled for this option and so far it is working perfectly for me. In fact, I am writing this review on iPad that is propped up with it.The only problem that I have with it is the manufacturing quality. The first holder that I bought broke after a few months of use. I still went ahead and bought a new one because I feel that its many advantages far outweigh this shortcoming, and hopefully if I am a bit more careful with how I store it and handle it it may last longer this time around.", "summary": "The no-frills book stand", "product_name": "Mighty Bright 37401 Fold-n-Stow Book Holder", "product_id": "1891747401"}
