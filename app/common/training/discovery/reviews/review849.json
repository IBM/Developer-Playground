NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner", "summary": "It Holds any book and turning pages is easy", "product_name": "Mighty Bright 37401 Fold-n-Stow Book Holder", "product_id": "1891747401"}
