The only ones I could find were disposable, and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.  (See some of my other reviews)The Smidgets are the perfect size for salad dressings, little candy treats or marshmallows, raisins, nuts...if it's little, it flies!  You'll love them.  I followed the tip from another Amazon reviewer and boiled them for 1 minute then re-sealed them while they are still hot to make the lids easier to take on and off.  Worked like a charm.", "summary": "Perfect size for the kids lunchboxes", "product_name": "Tupperware Smidgets in Pink and Red Set of 5", "product_id": "7535549756"}
