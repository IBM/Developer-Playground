I took a chance and ordered one of the 'used' models (it hadn't been opened but the box had a little damage.) The cup was in perfect, pristine condition and was only $6 shipped. My husband also likes it but his fingers are far too big to fit in the holes (I have pretty small hands and they are snug in it.)", "summary": "Awesome design", "product_name": "Design Fist Cup Brass Knuckle Duster Handle Coffee Milk Ceramic Fist Mug Cup Cool Gift", "product_id": "1983475912"}
