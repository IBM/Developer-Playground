I got one about 2 or 3 weeks ago and I'm sending it back. I have put no more than 1/2 cup at a time, of nuts, pieces of cut up carrots, etc. Every time I use it, this processor gives off a very strong, terrible smell of HOT PLASTIC!!! My opinion is, it's a piece of junk, and given how it smells when it's used, it won't last long!!! I would not recommend anyone buy this processor. It's not worth the effort to have to send it back!!! It's JUNK!!! DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!I received the new KitchenAid 3 cup mini yesterday, that I ordered to replace the Cuisinart... and WOW what a difference. I had read a review, that said the Cuisinart was as good as the KitchenAid mini... HAAAA!!! That had to have been a paid Cuisinart review, it sounded just like a paid ad for Cuisinart!Yes it cost more, for the KitchenAid, but man it is well worth it!!! The Cuisinart wouldn't even chop pieces of cut up veggies, using the pulse method as instructed, I stood there forever, pulsing over and over only to smell a horrible hot plastic stink, and chunks of veggie left in the processor, and if there was any moisture in the chopping bowl... it leaked out in drops thrown all around the processor on the counter. And yes the top was on correctly and the chopping blade was on properly. So when you read a review that sounds like a paid ad for the product... Be aware... it probably is.", "summary": "DON'T BUY!!!
