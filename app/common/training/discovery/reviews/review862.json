It smoked on the first use and died on the second.  I ordered an oster blender and it's been working fine ever since... two or three years, never a problem.But I won't stop there.  Thought maybe I could find the problem or use the motor for another project, since I couldn't return the unit, took it apart and was absolutely flabbergasted with what I found.  I'm an electrical engineer and have been involved with designing and building all sorts of things through my life... but this takes the cake for poor design and unsafe practices.  The motor is mounted using a paper (not plastic, not cardboard) tube that fits into a plastic ridge at the top.  It rests on the bottom of the housing on a rubber grommet and is not anchored in place except for this PAPER tube, shaped like a toilet paper center.  So I threw the bottom half away, put a mason jar lid on the bottom of the nice glass jar and thought I'd use it as an orange juice container... bad idea... it won't pour without slopping down the front and all over the table.This is junk and shame shame on you cuisinart... I'm sure they bought it from someone else because they would NEVER have designed something this badly... someone was making it as a joke!", "summary": "Even Worse Than Meets the Eye!", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
