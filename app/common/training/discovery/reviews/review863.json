When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry), we did not have \"proof of purchase\" and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer \"service\" again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service.", "summary": "Bad Blender / Bad Warranty", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
