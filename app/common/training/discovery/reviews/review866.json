Want a flavor no one sells?  Mix it yourself with this easy-to-use machine.  Even basic flavors are great when you control the ingredients that go in.The machine is not messy, as it requires no ice or rock salt, and all of the parts are fairly easy to wash.  The recipes in the instruction book work just fine.A bit of advice;1)Read the instructions carefully.2)Plan for some lead time.  You need to have the bowl completely frozen. (If you need to make more than one batch at a time, you can buy an extra freezer bowl.)3)Bear in mind that the ice cream will still be soft when the machine is done with it. (This is true with most ice cream machines.) You will still need to put it in the freezer for a while before serving.4)Indulge in high quality ingredients; for example, get some whole vanilla beans for your vanilla ice cream. (If you want a lot of them, eBay is the cheapest place to get them.)I am delighted with this purchase and just can not imagine buying ice cream from the store again.", "summary": "Ice cream just the way you want it!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
