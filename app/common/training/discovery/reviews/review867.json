I suppose the glass carafe COULD crack, but I'd probably need to take a sledge hammer to it, LOL.It also crushes ice like nobody's business, which was the final deciding factor. A couple other reviews mentioned issues with the button labels peeling off (under warranty, I'd have gotten an immediate replacement - could have missed QC), dripping into the blade housing (no clue how that could happen unless the user held a glass directly over the blade seat) and the motor burning out after \"only\" 2 years (no mention whether the use was extremely heavy, or not). Those really didn't concern me since there were only a few of those. The more predominant reviews were fairly glowing, and those I paid attention to.Mine won't get daily ice crushing duties...only occasional...and I have no plans to try and crush seeds/nuts/cinnamon sticks (that's what my spice grinder and food processor are for), so that doesn't really concern me. The only thing that I would have wished for is a metal motor housing, instead of plastic. I'll just have to be a little extra careful with it. It's the sole reason I took off 1 star, but this is probably normal for modern, small appliances. Unfortunately, almost nothing is made to last, any longer. Planned obsolesence/replacement, so they can keep seling them, LOL.I'm more than pleased with my choice.", "summary": "Glass carafe, crushes ice and it's PINK!", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
