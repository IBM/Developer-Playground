I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder. The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces. The Cuisinart purees their little hearts out. The mechanical construction is still the Achilles heel but if I can get 2-3 years daily service for 59 bucks, I'm good.Btw, Progresso Manhattan Clam Chowder is a watery mess from the can. Once it's throughly blended, like a shrimp bisque, it's a world class soup. I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant. I've had one can a day for twenty years. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick). Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup, but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups.", "summary": "Blenders are task-specific", "product_name": "Cuisinart SPB-7 SmartPower 40-Ounce 7-Speed Electronic Bar Blender, White DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER", "product_id": "B00000JGRQ"}
