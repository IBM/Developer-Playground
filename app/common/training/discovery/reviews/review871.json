I love all the sorbets, ice milks and ice creams that we can make.  It is simple to use, and the results taste great!My only complaint is how loud the machine is.  I can't really let the machine run while we are having dinner unless I put the ice cream maker far away from the kitchen and dining room.  But other than that inconvenience, I can't complain.I would agree with the other reviewers -- use cold ingredients, and start your ice cream as soon as you take the bowl out of the freezer.  I let my bowl freeze for at least two days before using it.  I put it in a plastic bag, and then put a zip-loc bag of ice in the container just to be sure.I have a hard time using all of the egg yolks and heavy cream to make true \"ice cream\" (although a splurge once in awhile isn't a bad thing!).  I try to stick to the lower fat recipes.  You can find endless recipes and ideas on the internet.  I must admit that when in a hurry I just throw together some milk, half and half, real mexican vanilla, sugar, and a pinch of salt (no recipe here, just taste it to your own creaminess and sweetness level) to make ice cream for dessert.  It's like having fresh soft serve.  Yum!If you would like your own ice cream maker, you can't go wrong with this machine!", "summary": "Easy to use and makes GREAT product!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
