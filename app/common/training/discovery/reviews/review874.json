The bowl goes into the freezer until it has frozen solid (I just leave mine in there all the time so it's frozen when I need it), and in two seconds the base is set up and I'm pouring in French Vanilla Bean ice cream, or champagne citrus sorbet, or fresh peach ice cream with peach chunks.  Sorbet is as easy as grinding up some frest fruit in the food processor or blender, mixing in a simple sugar syrup that takes 5 mins. to make with sugar and water, and optionally adding a little lemon juice or a teaspoon or two of alcohol to give it a softer consistency.  I like adding champagne -- it softens the texture but tastes great as well, giving it an added tanginess that helps keep the sorbet from being too sweet.  Clean-up is a breeze as there are only three parts to clean.  The freezer bowl, the plastic piece that sits inside it, and the top.Seriously, I have not bought commercially made ice cream since I got this maker.  I just go to the market, see what looks freshest , and it's sorbet within a few hours.  Ice creams almost as easy and much better than Steve's, Baskin Robbins, etc.  I can't say enough about this little unit that looks like nothing.  It's sure something!  And at less than $50, it's a bargain.  I've bought them for all my friends.", "summary": "Best kitchen value I've ever received -- this maker rocks!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
