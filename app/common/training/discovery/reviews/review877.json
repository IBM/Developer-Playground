I was really looking forward to making low-carb ice cream, but, no dice. At the end of the 25-30 minutes, still just totally liquid sweetened half-and-half.  I've kept the freezer bowl in the freezer for a week, used the most basic recipes, even with sugar, just in case that was the problem. I've tried about 6 times with different ingredients, chilling it all, adding flavorings and sweeteners only at the end.  A couple of times I ended up with butter because I just couldn't believe that a cuisinart product could fail so utterly and I just kept it turning. What a disappointment!  On the plus side, I've found I can salvage the ingredients in two ways.  First and simplest, just pour it into popsicle molds and freeze those.  Not creamy in texture, but still a nice frozen treat.  The other method I learned at our local children's science museum.  Put the cream mix into a zip-loc bag.  Tak another large zip-loc bag and put in a couple dozen ice cubes, and 1/3 cup of salt--just regular table salt works totally fine.  Put the yummy bag into the bag of ice. Now shake it for about 10 minutes, until it turns into ice cream.  If you wish, you can use a pair of legging-type pants for a convenient shaker.  Turn the pants half-way inside out, so that one leg is inside the other.  Put the double bag into the middle of the leg, grab both ends and shake. You don't have to shake very vigorously. Check to see how it's coming along every 5 minutes or so.  Once it's frozen, open the salt-water bag, take out the ice cream bag and give it a quick rinse to wash away the salt.  Voila!", "summary": "Just doesn't work", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
