I bought this device and raced them head to head and the next week the hand crank maker was out by the curb for trash collection!This thing works GREAT! Use your imagination and try some fresh fruit sorbets, make a simple syrup and then freeze it with lime juice, for instance -- it's incredible! I find that using instant espresso powder gives me a real coffee flavor kick when I make coffee ice cream. And there's a recipe in the included booklet for Jell-O Pudding Ice Cream, which my kids rave about.I found some apricot juice at the market and used it in the ice cream maker -- it turned out some gourmet-like apricot sorbet! WOW!!!I tend to avoid the heavy cream called for in the recipes and use at most half and half with milk. Too much milkfat tastes gross. Too little tastes icy and awful.It's simple, it works well, it's not all that expensive and the ice cream you'll make is easily better than the most expensive storebought ice cream available! The machine has a small footprint and the only noise it makes is kind of a \"rawr rawr rawr\" as it rotates the central vessel. All you have to do is mix the ice cream base, pour it in the machine and flip the switch!", "summary": "Terrific, painless little ice cream maker!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
