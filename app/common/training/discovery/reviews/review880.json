It is still running.  It still works fine.  But, I will be replacing it soon with an electric machine that is self-contained for a number of reasons.This machine only makes soft serve ice cream.  In order to get the density that we are accustomed to in purchased ice cream the soft serve ice cream has to be dispensed into another container and then frozen for at least an hour, preferably overnight.  Be certain to start with a very cold base ice cream, or the ice cream will not even reach a soft serve state.This machine is not quiet.  It makes much more noise than it would appear capable of generating.In order to be able to make ice cream the freezer compartment needs to be solidly frozen.  How long this takes is dependent on how cold your freezer is inside.  I usually put mine in the night before I plan to use it.  I also make my ice cream base the day before so that it will be completely cold when it enters the ice cream canister.If you plan to add nuts or fruit to your ice cream do this after the base has reach a soft serve state to keep the nuts and fruits from getting broken up to fine, unless that is your intention.If you make ice cream, sherbet, or sorbet infrequently this machine will suit your need.  If you don't currently make ice cream at home and just want to try to make ice cream to determine if a machine will get used, this item would also make sense.  However, if you are an experienced ice cream maker, and expect to use an ice cream maker frequently I would suggest investigating the models that chill the bowl on their own (without you having to put something into your freezer overnight).", "summary": "good for a first ice cream machine", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
