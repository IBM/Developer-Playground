One problem I had at first was that when I used mostly heavy cream, the finished product was too airy and the ice cream broke apart when I tried to scoop it. My bowl was super cold (overnight, lowest freezer setting) and it got to the \"soft serve\" stage fairly quickly. My mistake was that I left it going too long, hoping it would get firmer. It basically whipped the cream. I don't know if you've ever eaten frozen whipped cream, but it's not a treat! This only happens when bowl is close to zero degrees Farenheit, the mixture is very chilled, and the ambient temperature isn't too hot.If you're wondering what I mean by \"too long,\" it's when the ice cream starts to rise above the churning paddle. If it looks like soft serve but you want it to be harder, transfer the ice cream to another container, cover it, and put it in the freezer.For SUPER SMOOTH ice cream, try one of the recipes that uses eggs and a heated mixture.
