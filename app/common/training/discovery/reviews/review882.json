The first one lasted almost 2 years and made outstanding coffee.  The second one makes absolutely terrible coffee.  I have come to the conclusion that this second machine doesn't get the water hot enough so the coffee is weak and bitter no matter what I do.  The temp in the carafe at the conclusion of brewing is only 150 degrees.  I spent so much time and money thinking it was my error, but now I'm fairly sure it isn't my fault.If you get a good one it's great, but the one I have now makes undrinkable coffee.  I bought a refurbished one the second time around, I'll never make that mistake again.  There's a reason why those products are so much cheaper.", "summary": "Hit or miss...", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
