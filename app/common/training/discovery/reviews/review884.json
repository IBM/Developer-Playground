Sure it isn't the fanciest, the bowls take up a lot of freezer space, and it certainly isn't quiet; but it makes a good amount of delicious - consistently textured ice-cream, is gentle enough that you can use almost any ingredients you like, and is simple to clean (even by hand if, like me, you lack a dish-washer).  Assuming you have the freezer space to keep one of the bowls prep'd you can go from zero to enjoying excellent soft serve in about 30 minutes. Overall a great product.NOTE: For most of the recipes I've tried, this machine produces ice-cream of a consistency akin to soft serve.  Very tasty in any-case and things harden up nicely in the freezer if you have time to wait.  But those wanting to serve cones right from the machine may be forced to make very small batches to accommodate this models limited ability to quickly freeze.", "summary": "An excellent maker for the value minded.", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
