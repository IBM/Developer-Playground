This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months, I couldn't get it out, even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off, when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also \"beeps\" at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee, but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement.", "summary": "The little stuff will make you throw this in the trash!", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
