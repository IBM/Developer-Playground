My mother had wanted one for awhile, but always thought they were well over $100.  I found a refurbished one (which further made me worry, wondering why Amazon had so many refurbs if the product was reliable), and decided to give it a try.They have been nothing but happy with it since I gave it to them.  It has been used almost every day since Christmas 2003, and they have not had one problem.  Cleaning takes a little more time than a regular maker, but they say it is well worth it for how fresh the coffee tastes.Just remember...90% of people who post reviews are those who had problems.  Most people without problems never think to bother.Update - 12/9/08 - Apparently it finally died about 3 months ago, so it made it through 5 years of almost daily use.  My parents loved it so much they bought another one.  I'd still give it 5 stars.  The main reason I think these do break now and then is because you do have to take a couple minutes every time you use the grind feature and clean it out.  My parents did that, but I can certainly see a lot of people getting lazy and not cleaning it every time.", "summary": "The perfect gift", "product_name": "Cuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Black", "product_id": "B00000JGRS"}
