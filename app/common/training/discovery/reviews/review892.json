Firstly, I have to admit that I've never made ice cream in it.  I much prefer sorbets.  And oh, what wonderful one's you can make!  The machine is super easy to use, as long as you remember to store the freezer bowl in the freezer.  Just pour in some juice, sugar and a couple flavorings, let it spin for 20 minutes or so, and you will have the most wonderful summer treats.  My favorite?  Fresh grapefruit juice with sugar, fresh mint, and lime juice.  People love it.  You can also use it to make somewhat more &quot;adult&quot; fare.  Use a bit of sugar and a bit of alcohol, for instance, a bit of tequila with the grapefruit juice and voila - wonderful adult party fare.Clean up is easy, storage is easy.  The only down side to this machine is that once you start making your own stuff, it's neigh on to impossible to stop.  On the other hand, since you're making it yourself and can limit what ingredients you use, the end result can be enormously healthy.  And what better than sitting in the sun, enjoying a big bowl of wonderful sorbet, and knowing as empiric fact that what you're eating is also pretty darned good for you.I've given this ice cream maker to several people as gifts.  They've all loved it.", "summary": "This Ice Cream Maker is a Gem", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
