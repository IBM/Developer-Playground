I am an ice-cream nut, so I'm a little bit biased - but only since this machine makes making ice cream so easy!  You do have to freeze the bowl beforehand, which is a slight inconvenience, but unless you're planning to make a ton of ice cream all at the same time it's no big deal.  It also makes GOOD ice cream - I haven't had a complaint yet! Highly recommend!", "summary": "Super Easy Ice Cream!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
