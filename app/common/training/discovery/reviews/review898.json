I use it at least twice a week and the ice cream comes out perfect every time. When first made, the ice cream is about the consistency of soft serve or a Wendy's Frosty. That's just fine with me, the flavor is best this way. After freezing whatever is left of the batch, the consistency is like store bought ice cream. I do not do anything fancy with it, just follow the directions in the included booklet for basic vanilla ice cream. In fact, the recipe calls for heavy cream and whole milk but I substitute 1 cup Half & Half and 2 cups low fat (2%) milk to keep it lower cal, and the consistency is still plenty smooth!Like other reviewers have said, be sure to freeze that container for plenty of time before using. Otherwise the ice cream will be real runny. I try to freeze it for 24 hours before use. As long as the directions are followed on this machine, it makes great ice cream every time. Highly recommend it. This is by far my most used kitchen gadget. Love it! Am going to buy another one as a gift right now.", "summary": "Excellent and easy ice cream machine!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
