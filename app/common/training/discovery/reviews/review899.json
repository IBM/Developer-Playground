Yes, in theory, it can make ice cream, but not the ice cream that's worth the time and effort. I consistently got batches of ice cream that were \"icy.\" NO, this was not a temperature problem. I would chill my custard for well over a day, and I would leave the bowl in the freezer for weeks. So, if you're looking for an ice cream that will not knock your socks off, this is not the machine. If you want something that will make quick \"icy\" ice cream, then this is your machine. You're better off with the old ice and rock salt ice cram makers; at least those machines can make ice cream that's smooth. Incredibly poor designing by cuisinart. I expect better from them; the paddle design seems to be the crux of the problem. The paddle doesn't adequately scrap the sides of the bowl.  Also, I can't believe how many people have actually said they liked this thing. Low expectations I guess.", "summary": "Complete waste of money!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
