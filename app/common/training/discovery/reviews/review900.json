But my sister is on chemo, and I found out she dislikes the taste of commercial ice cream, even the expensive stuff. SO I bought this , and made a batch of strawbeerry, an instant hit.the machine is easy to use,and it arrived in the mail in one day!! I followed all the reviews that said \"chill everything\" be careful not to over fill, it makes a bit of mess, and have nice strawberry ice cream , and the bowl is cold in six hours, so I will make peach tonight.I can see this machine is a winner, sorbet and fresh fruit ice cream, with less sugar and no preservatives will capitvate us all summer.( and four sessions of chemo).oh, I borrowed the ben and jerrys book from the library, and now need a copy, its easy and not confusing at all. I love to cook, but don't need complicated cooking with a sick sister.**** for fathers day I made a 1/2 batch of strawberry ice cream, prechilled the cream mix, added strwberries the last 2 minutes and we had perfect  ice cream out of the mixer.***so PRECHILL THE CREAM BASE, AND ADD FRUIT AT THE LAST SECOND AND DO NOT OVERLOAD THE MACHINE.", "summary": "wow, cool and easy!!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
