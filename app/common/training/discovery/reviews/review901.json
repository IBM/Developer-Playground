In the first few months - I must have tried about a dozen recipes - some good and some bad, but none were any fault of this ice cream maker.  Once I learned that you have to put the freezing compartment in the BACK of the freezer and make sure it stays there for at least a couple days between uses - I no longer had soupy ice cream.  Once I learned that you absolutely have to have a decent fat source in every recipe (no low-cal stuff here) - I no longer had hard ice cream that needed an ice pick to be chipped out.  From chocolate candy cane, to cinnamon apple crumble, to avocado (yes!) - this ice cream maker helped my vegan ice cream dreams come true.  I gave only 4 stars simply because, with this design, there is no way to prevent ice cream from gathering on the edges and keeping the middle from getting as cold as it could.  With better side-scrapers or some kind of middle-freeze-chamber - it could be better.", "summary": "Great for the price once you know how to use it", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
