I was buying on the name recognition only, best price, and expected a glorified toy.  But, this little machine is not only cute... it is EASY to use and delivers! It's truly a professional kitchen appliance that works like a charm!  In addition, it is easy to use... just pour in the recipe... flip the switch... 25 minutes later you're eating the real deal.", "summary": "Excellent Buy!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
