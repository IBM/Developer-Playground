My only complaint is I wish it were a 2-quart capacity; the ice cream is so good but goes so fast!  The recipes in the accompanying booklet produce just the right texture in the finished product, and after a few tries you can easily modify them to make any flavor you desire.It's ideal for whipping up a premium dessert in a short amount of time when you have last-minute guests; just keep plenty of whole milk and heavy cream in the back of the fridge at all times!  Everyone who has tried my mocha-toffee-hazelnut homemade ice cream from this machine has loved it, and quite a few have proclaimed it the best ice cream they have ever eaten.  And you just can't beat how quick and easy it is to make.One tip -- make sure you have a 2-quart plastic container on hand to store the ice cream; you cannot store it in the mixing bowl because it is easily damaged.  In general, right after you take the ice cream out of the mixer, it can be served right away if you have kept your ingredients very cold, but its texture will benefit from spending at least an hour in the coldest part of your freezer.Some people have complained about the noise; it's loud enough to bother a cat but not so loud you can't talk over it.  Definitely not a reason to avoid purchase.", "summary": "Super-easy to use; makes first-rate ice cream in a half-hour", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
