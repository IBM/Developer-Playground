When I first started using mine for dinner parties, I would apologetically excuse myself, duck in the kitchen, muffle the noise of the freezer with a towel and scoot back every so often to check on progress.What I discovered was that people like to gather around the thing while it's running, so now I simply hand people a drink while I get the ingredients and we all stand around watching dessert happen.This last-minute approach has another advantage: it gives you incredible freedom when it comes to recipes. You see, the chemistry of freezing foods has its own set of built-in limits. You need to add appropriate amounts of sugar and alcohol to lower the freezing point of your mixture so that you get an ice and not an ice cube*.Making your ice just before you serve it allows you a lot of freedom. Since you'll be serving it right away, you can stop the machine whenever the mixture looks right. The whole process is really easy, so if you buy an extra bowl, you can experiment with  different flavors in one meal or even try some unsweetened ices in the middle of a meal. (Cucumber puree frozen with mint in the middle of a July 4th dinner turns out to be a million times better than it sounds.)Be sure to allow enough time beforehand  for bowls to chill in the freezer and make sure all ingredients are cold before you start.Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine*A great source of explanation of freezing foods and some recipes is Harold McGee's The Curious Cook.", "summary": "Lots of fun and extremely versatile", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
