We lost a part on our first during a move, tried a couple alternate brands, and ended up buying another Cuisinart as the other brands just didn't work as well for us.We found that the bowl on this brand seems to freeze more solid, thus making thicker ice cream despite the ambient temperature of the room. The others we used would barely hit super soft serve on hot days, whereas this will get to super thick soft serve.Additionally, it just seems to be more sturdy and the motor isn't quite as loud as the others we'd tried (but it's not whisper soft by any means)In addition, we're dairy free, so have to make non-animal milk ice creams. We reverse engineered coconut bliss coconut ice cream (coconut milk based) and it is incredibly good! Everyone we've made it for has loved it - even die hard \"real\" ice cream fans!Here is our recipe for those interested:Note: This recipe is sized to work in this specific Cuisinart home ice cream maker & makes about a pint and a half or so...one big and one little can of coconut milkvanilla 1 tspagave 3 1/2 tbsp, and 9 drops of stevia (to decrease the overall sugars)4 tbsp cocoa powder (we use raw, organic)1/4 tsp Himalayan pink salt1/2 tsp hazelnut or almond extract (makes the overall flavor more rich and full)optional - 2 tbsp of kefir or yogurt (we use coconut milk kefir - gives an added richness)Stir all in a bowl until well mixed, add to ice cream maker bowl, turn on and proceed as usual.  YUM!!(no cooking or creepy ingredients required!)", "summary": "Better than other brands we've tried & great for dairy free ice cream too!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
