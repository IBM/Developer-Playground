I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things, like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time, it seemed too easy, but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer, but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something.", "summary": "where have you been all my life?", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
