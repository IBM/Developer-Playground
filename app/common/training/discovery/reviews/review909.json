It is made entirely out of cheap plastic and the motor sounds like a dentist drill.  Even the canister is made out of plastic and now there are scratches in it from when I scooped the ice cream out with a metal spoon.  I followed the directions exactly and after 1 hour it was still liquid.The next time I used it (again having the canister in the freezer for 24 hours prior to making the recipe), I put the mixture in the canister and then put it in the freezer and covered it with tin foil.  I hand-stirred the mixture every 10 minutes and after 1 hour, it was done.Instead of buying this product, I would recommend mixing the ingredients together and then putting it in a plain plastic container directly in the freezer.  It will take 8-10 hours for it to harden.  You can use the following recipe to start:10 oz plain frozen strawberries (slightly thawed)1/2 cup sugar10 oz heavy whipping creamPuree the strawberries and sugar.  Mix in the whipping cream with the other ingredients for about 2 minutes or until the whipping cream thickens.  Pour into a plastic container and place in the freezer.  You may wish to stir the mixture every 2 hours so that it hardens more quickly.", "summary": "Cheaply Made & Overpriced", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
