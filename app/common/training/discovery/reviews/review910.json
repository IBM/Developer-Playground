I finally got a great deal on it at Amazon, and snapped it up. Within three days, I had bought the ingredients needed to make strawberry ice cream and couldn't wait to get started.Unfortunately, the instructions are incorrect when it comes to telling you how long to freeze the bowl. It says that you can freeze it for 6-22 hours, or until you shake the bowl and can't hear any liquid sloshing around. So, I froze the bowl for 6 hours and sure enough, no sloshing. But, this is simply not enough! My strawberry ice cream tasted wonderful, but in the machine never made it past a thick liquid stage. I had to put it in the freezer for hours to get it hard enough to eat. The texture suffered, but the flavor was still great.The next time I made ice cream, I froze the bowl for two days while I was out of town. I got some really great Kaluha ice cream out of it, and I've bought a second bowl so I'll always have one ready to make frozen treats.When used correctly, this ice cream maker is wonderful! But used according to the optimistic instructions, all you get is disappointment.", "summary": "Machine is great, but the instructions are not", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
