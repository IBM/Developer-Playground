The liquid never turned to ice cream.  I tried two different recipes - I was very disappointed. Since my first two attempts bombed,I went online and read as much as I could to figure out why I couldn't make ice cream and 900 other people could with this machine.  Here's what I found out.  1st)Freezer temp is extremely important (get a thermometer and lower freezer temp till it reads 0 degrees) - mine had been set at the factory recommended setting of middle range, so I turned it down to the lowest setting. 2)Container needs to be really frozen - don't put in a cramped freezer, allow space around container so it freezes throughly all around container. I had it in freezer three days this time 3)Recipe needs to be cooled as well!  With my first attempts, the ingredients were at room temperature and then in the frig an hour or so - on my third try I put recipe in frig for three nights in the back of frig where it is the coldest.Voila!!!!! Trying out this new information produced the coveted creamy frozen ice cream I had read others were making!!!!!  I give this machine 4 stars because the company didn't offer thorough instructions in their booklet (I was close to throwing the machine out into the trash), and the preparations took me several days to get the right temperatures in the container and the recipe.  I am on a roll now though and look forward to making many more favors.", "summary": "Not happy at first, but I have figured it out now!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
