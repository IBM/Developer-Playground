That idea appealed to me so that I went straight to Amazon and bought my first ice cream maker. Just two days ago, my Cuisanart Ice Cream Maker (1 1/2 quart) arrived and the freezer bowl went straight into the freezer.  This ice cream maker is very easy to use and comes with very clear instructions. I discovered that you must follow the instructions exactly.  The \"blade\" must be seated in the bowl, the lid put on, and the power turned on in that exact sequence before pouring the \"batter\" into the freezer bowl.  If that sequence is not followed the lid won't fit properly.  One of the real plus factors of this product is that it is easy to make only a pint at a time, since I am experimenting with a variety of flavors.  The fact that the ice cream is soft when finished is also a plus factor for me because it is then easy to pour the ice cream into my pint containers. If the finished product were as solid as it becomes after going back into the freezer, it would be too hard to get the ice cream out of the freezer bowl and into the pint containers.  I have make five pint batches of ice cream in seven days and couldn't be happier with this maker.", "summary": "Heaven on a Spoon Lemon Nutmeg", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
