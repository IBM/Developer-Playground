Our first batch of ice cream didn't turn out so well.  It wasn't very thick, but we quickly discovered we had not left the tub in the freezer long enough before we started.Once we figured out you should really put the tub in the freezer overnight and make the ice cream the next day, and only let it run for about 20 minutes as suggested, you get perfect ice cream every time.  The small batch is plenty for 2 large servings or 4 small ones, so there's never any leftovers.  The tub cleans up very easily too.It's great for a simple vanilla mixture using milk, cream, and sugar every time, but we've crunched up M&M;'s for a batch which was wonderful.  During the holidays we added a touch of Baileys which was amazing. We did try a fresh squeezed orange sorbet as well but found it really needed a lot of sugar to cut the acidity.  I'd probably just try frozen juice concentrate next time.Be sure to keep the instruction book!  There are lots of ideas and recipes inside.  I'm looking forward to trying the fresh basil and lemon sorbet this summer. Overall, for the price you pay and the simplicity of the device, it was a smart investment for our kitchen. We generally spend about $10 in ice cream every other week during the summer, so this maker has already paid for itself!", "summary": "The Best Kitchen Counter Top Ice Cream Maker For The Price!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
