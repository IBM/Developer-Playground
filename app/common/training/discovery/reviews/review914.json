Ben and Jerry, eat your heart out.  This is so easy there's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again.  No locust bean gum, no artificial color, no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want.  The ice cream tastes awesome, and I would recommend this machine to anyone, especially those who cannot use a hand crank machine, or don't want the fuss and muss of using salt.", "summary": "Get this machine!!!!!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
