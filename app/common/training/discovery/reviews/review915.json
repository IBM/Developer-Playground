I use it to make non-dairy ice cream with Vances Dari-Free which is a powdered milk substitute made from potatoes. It works absolutely brilliantly and for the first time in a decade I actually had 'ice cream'. With Vances you must pre-make the ice cream mix in a pot and heat it. The mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours. Then simply place it in the Cuisinart and turn on. In a half hour you end up with a soft serve ice cream that tastes just like the real thing. The device is so easy to use and clean we've been using it every day! This is one of the greatest items I have purchased in a long time and I only regret that I waited so long to get one. Here's my recipe I developed:In a pot add:9 tablespoons of powdered Vances Darifree (or any powdered milk)3 tablespoons of tapioca starch flour6 tablespoons of sugar3 cups of waterTurn heat on medium and whisk constantly to combine the dry mix with water and to prevent sticking to the pot. The mix will begin to thicken after a few minutes.Now add:1/3 cup of any butter, margarine of choice+1 or 2 teaspoons of Vanilla or other extractContinue heating and whisking until the mixture is completely combined and thickened. I do this until it begins a low boil - bubbles and steam begin.Cool in fridge and follow ice cream maker instructions.* If you want to use soy milk, rice milk or other milk simply eliminate the powdered Vances and water and replace with any 3 cups liquid substitute.* If you want to make Carob or Chocolate ice cream add 1/4 cup powdered cocoa or roasted carob to the dry mix.", "summary": "Makes perfect ice cream - even non-dairy!", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
