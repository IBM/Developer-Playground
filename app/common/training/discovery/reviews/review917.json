An ice cream maker rookie, I was rather skeptical by the ease-of-use claims. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the product *is* easy to use and makes yummy desserts in a very short period of time [Freezing Time + 10 Minutes (Prep) + 25 Minutes (Machine)].In order to make frozen desserts (anything from ice milk to margaritas), all you have to do is freeze the bowl, assemble the machine, pour in your ingredients and turn it on. That's it.Notes:- The instruction book contains a few basic recipies, including vanilla ice cream and sherbet, to get you started. This is helpful if you want to make a batch right away.- Watch the proportions in the recipies, as they are not exact. You may want to taste your mixture before putting it into the machine. (For example, the &quot;Very Berry Frozen Yogurt&quot; recipe featured in the book asked for only a 1/4 cup of sugar -- far too little.)- The machine is *considerably* louder than you may expect. (Think blender &amp; old diswasher combined!) It would be prudent to make ice cream *before* guests come over -- or else you'll all be yelling over the din.- The machine contains no small or sharp parts. As such, small children (with your supervision) can use this to try out their cooking skills.Enjoy!", "summary": "Easy, Yummy &amp; Loud", "product_name": "Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White", "product_id": "B00000JGRT"}
