So many great meals she prepared with it. I came to the US in 1965 and had to left them in Havana until 1970 when she and my father finally came to joint me here in the US.  After a few days of them here we went to buy  cooking utensils and kitchenware for our new home here in Miami.  I purchased for her a Presto 6 quart and 4 quart cooker.  Do not have to say she was delighted.  She used them like in Cuba, almost every day for many, many delicious meals, until she was very old (92 years old) and passed away in 1995.  I still have these Prestos and they are like new.  I just have ordered the gaskets and pressure valve through the Presto site here in the Web.  Just to say I cook a lot myself and used them very often.  Presto stands back on all their models and have replacement parts for all their cookers old and new.  They even have the originals Manuals with recipes and user instructions and times for every model the have ever produced.  I should say these cookers would last for generations if well treated and cleaned. They are part of the dear memories I have of my family.", "summary": "My Family history with these Presto Pressure Cookers", "product_name": "Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N601"}
