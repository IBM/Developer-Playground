It...Cannot keep the handle tight, I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal, steam leaks out around the handles, making them hot to touch, and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word, we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market.", "summary": "Cheap and That's What it's Worth", "product_name": "Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N601"}
