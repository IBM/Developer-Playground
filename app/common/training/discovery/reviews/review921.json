I always forgot to take it off before opening the lid, and one time it fell down hard on the floor, almost hitting my toes.  Turns out there's a purpose.  It's a visual/audio indicator of how much steam is coming out.  If it rocks too fast then I'd need to lower the fire.  On a pressure cooker, more heat doesn't cook any faster.  It only wastes gas/electricity and drains out the liquid inside faster.Although the manual recommends waiting for the steam to go away by itself before opening the lid, or dunk the whole thing into cold water, which could be a few minutes.  I usually take a very long spatula, position my hand below the lid and gently pry the rocker cap off to let the steam out faster.  If you do this, be very careful or else you'd get burn.  Seriously, this is hotter than normal steam.It works very well.  Holds pressure much better than my old Mantra pressure cooker, and thus tenderizes the meat much faster.At first I was hesitant to buy stainless steel, because it's more expensive and doesn't conduct heat well.  But the bottom has a layer of other metal to absorb heat, so it's not any different compared to my aluminum Mantra cooker.  Stainless is easier to clean as well, and looks better.  Some people worry that aluminum causes alzheimer, but there's no medical proof of it.  Oh well, at least I get the stainless steel so that I don't have to wonder.", "summary": "The rocker thingie", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
