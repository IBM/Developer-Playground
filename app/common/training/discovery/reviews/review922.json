Coming from an asian background it's not something we normally cook with.  We normally go the \"slow cooking\" route instead to make our soups and broths.  This item is great in that you can make some good stock and soups etc in about 60 to 90 minutes.  I tried using this for the first time yesterday and it was great.  My wife was extremely skeptical at first, to the point of getting a backup plan for dinner but she's happy it worked out.The unit is well made, the handle locks easily and it has a safety feature that wont' allow you to unlock it when there is pressure.  the ONLY thing you have to worry about is knocking over the weighted pressure release and allowing steam to fly up.It does make some noise but I like it, it allows me to hear from afar if the heat setting is correct.  I find the size of the cooker to work well for 3-4 adults.  If you have more than that, get the 8qt or larger cooker.My ONE concern with this is losing the pressure release weight...other than that, I just bought another one to give to my mom :)", "summary": "Totally worth the money!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
