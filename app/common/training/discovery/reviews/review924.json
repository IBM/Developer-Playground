While my apartment is central air conditioned, I like to keep the thermostat on 78 to save energy. Having this fan definitely helps things feel cooler and results in less trips to the thermostat to turn down the temperature.When you crank this thing up to high, it's really a force to be reckoned with. My cat is slightly scared of it on higher settings as it does get a little loud and moves quite a bit of air.Added benefit is that if you use this in a bedroom at night, it serves as a pretty decent white noise source as well.Great fan all around, especially for those hot summer days.", "summary": "Lives up to it's name", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
