In truth, I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end, it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan, so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall, so while the handle on top makes it portable, and it's built to stand on the floor, it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!
