It comes already assembled so setup is a breeze--just remove it from the box, set it up on a table and turn it on! The three speeds all operate relatively quietly and the fan gets the air circulating rather quickly.The price is right for what you get: my own fan is just about two years old now and it still works strong and hard to create good air flow. The Wind Machine also cools the room down on days when you can't use an air conditioner or when you simply don't want to use one.I recommend that the fan stand on a flat surface about three or four feet high so that the air current it creates reaches you whether you're lying down or walking around the room. It is economical in that it won't make your electric bill spike upward, too.Overall, this is a great fan and I highly recommend it as just about the best fan out there in this size and price range. It will not disappoint you!", "summary": "The best fan in its class !!!", "product_name": "Lasko 3300 20\" Wind Machine 3 Speed Cooling 3300", "product_id": "B00002N5ZB"}
