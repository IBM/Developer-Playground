Have used it 10 (that's ten) times. I only hand wash it; I do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it. I use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes. No scratchers have been used on it. It is currently showing rust spots around the top edge. Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it, but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I don't wish to eat rust.It is also very lightweight compared to the old pressure cooker my mother had for over 40 years; maybe that is why the metal isn't very high quality.Firm believer in the old adage that you get what you pay for; my bad. Have ordered another brand that is pricier. I am not in the financial position to pay more for one specialty pan than I did for my entire set of stainless pots and pans, so we will see how this next one works out.", "summary": "You get what you pay for", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
