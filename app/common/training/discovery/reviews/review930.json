I bought it because it was cheap and  be easy to operate.  It was both of these and more.  I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker, how to gauge time and amounts of water etc.  Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers.  As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.  This style cooker has the \"jiggler valve\" on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds.  Personally, I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside.  You can go in the next room and still hear the hissing and know everything is going well.This (and all modern cookers) are very safe if you follow directions.  I was afraid of pressure cookers most of my life and this inexpensive one has soothed my fears.  It comes with a heat diffuser disk that sits on the bottom of the cooker and a nice instruction/recipe book.You can't go wrong with this, especially if you are a novice who does not want to spend big bucks on the electric cookers or expensive Swiss ones.  It does the job and does it well.", "summary": "No frills, no thrills", "product_name": "Mirro 92180A Polished Aluminum 10-PSI Pressure Cooker Cookware, 8-Quart, Silver", "product_id": "B00002N5ZP"}
