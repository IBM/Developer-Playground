Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker.  My mother had used one, and the name \"Presto\" really meant something to me.  Even though I was unfamiliar with this kind of cooker, the previous reviews left me confident that this one in particular would be a good choice.Yikes!  I opened the Amazon carton only to find a very small box for a 6-qt. cooker. Turns out, this pressure cooker will arrive at your door IN NEED OF ASSEMBLY.  Well, I was still game.  Pulled out my handy dandy Philips screwdriver and carefully followed directions.  The long handles had one screw only -- Not much for all the weight and pressure that pressure cooker handles must endure -- But I still gave it a shot.I made Chicken Chutney (recipe in the instruction booklet) which was \"okay\" -- Let's suppose that I haven't used a pressure cooker before (too true, too true).  So if the dish was \"meh,\" that could be my fault.  But ...As I was washing the cooker, it really became clear that the handle was loose.  The screw was as tight as possible (the instructions warn against screwing it too tight lest the plastic break), and the handle itself was clearly loose.  So. . .I am returning it to Amazon (they have made this very easy, UPS will even pick it up from my home).  In the meantime, I will be looking for a good quality stainless pressure cooker that is securely made, and doesn't come with \"assembly required.\"", "summary": "Flimsy Handle and \"Some Assembly Required\"", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
