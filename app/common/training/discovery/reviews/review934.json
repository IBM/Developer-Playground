It could be a little bigger, but it does the job very well.When 'boiling' food in a traditional pot, the food cannot exceed 212 degrees F (the temperature at which water boils).  Under pressure, the boiling point rises...  in this pressure cooker to about 250 degrees F.  This means, of course, that food cooks faster (the reason people normally think to buy a pressure cooker), but the higher temperature also allows other 'reactions' to take place while cooking... For instance, the tougher fibers in meat will convert to gelatin, making the meat more tender.  As a result,  pressure cookers are great for braised dishes with tough meats, such as chili.  For these purposes, this pressure cooker rocks.Larger pressure cookers can also be used for canning (because the higher temperatures can kill more bad things.  This pressure cooker really is not large enough for this task.  If you are not a canner though, compare the prices of this against those larger models... I think you will be back looking at this one.", "summary": "price is right, does the job.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
