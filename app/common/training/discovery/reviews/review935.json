I owned another brand for a short time, it did not perform the way my Presto does, so I gave it away! I have never had any problem with my pressure cooker's, Presto is very easy to use, just be sure to use the right amount of liquid with whatever you make, after time you will be a pro and will be able to make up your own recipes, it is fast, and makes the most toughest cut of meat super tender! I usually cook my 7-bone roast for 45 minutes, and the meat just falls apart! Great for cooking Artichokes too, add 1 1/2 cups of water, your Artichokes, place the lid on and when the cooker comes up to pressure, reduce heat to a slow rocking (the pressure regulator you put on the top of the lid) and cook for 15-17 minutes depending on the size of the Artichoke, they will be perfect! Do your own experimenting and enjoy the cooker, you will be hooked just like me!", "summary": "Presto Pressure Cooker***** The Best!", "product_name": "Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N601"}
