It was just sent as you would buy it at the store, which has minimal protection, and the box was Badly damaged when it arrived.I bought this heater because it is the best one I have used and when I went back to get a second one the store was already all out of them (Sears).The heater spreads the heat through a very large room (about 24 ft by 12 ft). Without it, the room just doesn't warm up no matter what other heater I tried.The other heater that works well in smaller size rooms and is smaller is the Holmes 1Touch heater. Sears was out of them too when I went back, fortunately I found them at Kmart too. Both have fans and really spread the heat throughout.For concentrated warm radiant type heat, my favorite is the Holmes 1Touch '319' model.I have tried many, and the best for spreading the warmth throughout and the fastest is this Lasko model, but I would not get another from the vendor on Amazon.", "summary": "Heater 5 stars - Vendor 0 stars", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
