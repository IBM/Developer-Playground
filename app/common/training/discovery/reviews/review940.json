My window sill is so narrow, I can't fit a box fan. This seemed like just the thing except... would it really fit my 27\" windows (some reviewers would say no) and what about the wooden window trim problem? I've got aluminum trim.It was needless worry. The unit went in with 1/2 inch to spare and guess what? You don't have to use the wooden mounting screws. I grabbed 4 1\"long machine screws with nuts to tighten them and extended the screws until it slide into the grooves of the window. Use some washers to reinforce the plastic. It does feel flimsy at the mount point. The pressure holds the unit in place. The fan is light enough and motor is smooth so it is unlikely it will vibrate itself out of the grooves unless I'm really careless about tightening the screws.I'm pleased this isn't a permanent solution (I didn't drill any holes in the trim). California summers sometimes get pretty darned cold so it's good to close the window entirely.I a very light sleeper so I would call the noise noticeable but not obnoxious except at the highest setting. But for my 1100 sq ft place, I can feel the air wafting throughout the entire length of the unit on high. There is no need to be in the same room to feel the benefit. I suspect I will use it before I go to bed and reduce the setting or turn it off.", "summary": "Got metal trim?
