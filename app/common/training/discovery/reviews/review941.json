My wife and I are both smokers.  This fan is very good at exhausting inside smoke to the outside.  Also when something starts smoking on the stove and fills the house with smoke, this fan will clear the whole house in less than a minute.  Electric reversing makes three speeds available for either exhausing or bringing fresh air in directly with just the twist of a knob. At medium and high speeds it helps to crack a window on the other side of the house.  Think of it as an 'attic fan' in your window.  Our window are 5' in height and this sits in the bottom 2' and since the window sill is only 8\" off the floor, the fan does not block the view at all except for the dogs.Two things: 1. Closely follow instructions when installing to avoid a noisy fan. Not properly mounted will result in vibration and more noise than necessary. (Also make sure base of fan is firmly sitting on the window sill when mounted...this will almost ensure vibration is minimal) 2. Fan needs to be cleaned at least annually (especially if you smoke).  You can remove 6 screws from inside the house which allows you access to clean the blades and the outside grill.Remember this fan is all plastic construction, fairly sturdy, but be careful not to strip screws by tightening too much.Finally, we've found that we are able to get a lot further into the summer season before we close up the house and turn on the central air because of this fan.", "summary": "Essential For Smokers", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
