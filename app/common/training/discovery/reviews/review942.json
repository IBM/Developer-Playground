I had to pre-drill for the screws.Pros: -not too loud, even on high (but then I grew up with a large metal box fan in my window)-Easy to change speed and direction-nice size, larger then typical 2 blade fan, just smaller or equal to box fan-appears to be well built.-should be easy to clean. The blade cover is held on with a couple of screws and it looks easy to remove and get to the blade.-privacy, the side panels not only hold the fan in well, but also create some privacy there.-close windows and leave fan in place; removal is easy any wayCons: - size, it is a good size but the way it juts into the room it could be intrusive in small spaces, no problems for me though-some rattle at low speed, bought 3 fans and one rattles so much on low that I keep it on medium. Other two barely rattle, it appears to occur where the blade is connected to the motor.-price, but the usability and sound construction indicate it will be worth the priceI bought these to replace several dual blade fans that died simultaneously. I really like these and would recommend them, but with the understanding that you will have permanent screws in the window sills year round.", "summary": "Large secured window fan", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
