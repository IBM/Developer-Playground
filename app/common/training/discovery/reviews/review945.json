It's not quite what I expected as an exhaust fan and did little to cool the room running for more than an hour w/a second window open in the same room.  So if you've got a window w/o a screen and there are a lot of bugs outside, exhaust would be ideal... but it doesn't work very well.  Recommend industrial ceiling mounted whole house fan if you prefer heat exhaust instead of blowing air in.  Turning on additional box fans at oposite ends of the house seemed to help move air exponentially faster with multiple windows open.  All-in-all, if your window is big enough or you have the means to gerry-rig a $20 box fan, that may be the way to go.  If you prefer something that looks nice, can stay in place even when the window is closed, this might be worth $70 to you... I kinda prefer taking the extra 2 minutes to put a box fan in the window and put it away when I'm done.", "summary": "Not blown away... pun intended", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
