Works pretty good, It has a clicking sound when you first turn it on, but no big deal. Not real loud on med and slow speed but on high a bit loud. I really like being able to  shut the window when the weather gets bad. Wish it had a little more power on high but for the price you cannot beat it.", "summary": "Fan of the fan", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
