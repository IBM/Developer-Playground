However, I popped the screen out, and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside, and stand in front of it, you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another, but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened, and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times, and I'm glad it's there, but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan.", "summary": "Fits perfect, and energy efficient.", "product_name": "Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches", "product_id": "B00002N5Z9"}
