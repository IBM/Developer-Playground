This is much better than the KR and in every way as good as the Fagor and it cost 1/5 the price of the KR and half the cost of the Fagor similar model.  Based on other reviews I replaced the Steel Screws with Stainless  2 each 10-24 x 3/4 pan head, 2 each 8/32 x 1/2 pan head and two 8/32 x 1/2 inch flat head.  I used locktite red on each to prevent them from loosening. So far no rust and no loosening.  Cost for the bolts was around $3 and since I had to assemble the handles anyway only the two flatheads inside the lid had to be removed from the original item.  Note the top is not stainless though or is a cheap imitation thereof..  It is magnetic so probably steel.  The pot itself is stainless.  Unlie the KR and FAGOR this pot weight wobbles making a noise.  I like that.  Aural and visual indication of pressure.  Nice..  Finish and fit are fine.  Bottom thick enough but not very thick.  All in all for $36 a good deal.  I am retiring the KR. because the screws keep pulling out of the handles (no inserts like this one) and other things keep failing like the gasket and handles themselves.  KR maintenance $30 per year, Fagor $0 per year (gasket once during it s 15 year life so far)  This pot, who knows, not much to go wrong.", "summary": "Hard to beat", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
