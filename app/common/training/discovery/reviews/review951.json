We were unsure of what exactly we were doing but this pressure cooker was pretty self-explanitory. It doesn't open if the steam is too hot which is great, because it definately avoids accidents (something we were a bit worried about).So far this pressure-cooker seems to be super heavy-duty. We've used it to can salmon fish and every single can came out sealed to perfection. We were SO pleased! We've also used it for ribs and potatoes and they are soo good. We've turned tough peices of reindeer meat into butter with this thing. It's really perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better beginner kitchen accessory.A few tips:To clean the pressure hole on the top of the lid pour boiling water through.Boil the weight to get sticky grime out.Oil the seal with vegetable oil every month or so to keep it sticky and let it last longer.To close the lid hold the handle and then level out the side with your hand while placing it on top- it definately helped us get it on correctly.", "summary": "We Use It For Everything!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
