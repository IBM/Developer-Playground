I have a Hawkins 2 liter cooker, prestige 3.5 liter and a presto 6 quart pressure cooker but they are all aluminum. I've had the presto 6 qt aluminum for at least over 6 years. It works very well. The best thing about it as compared to Hawkins and Prestige is that it doesn't let pressure off in loud installments (which scares the kids), its more like a consistent whistle.The main reason to buy the 4 qt steel cooker was to have a size between the ones I already owned, suitable for a family of four, and also the reason that stainless steel doesn't react with the food, which is important to me because I often marinate the meat before cooking certain dishes.The new presto has a flatter bottom which sits better on my cook top unlike the old one which rocks a little bit, the heating is even and its easier to clean as well. What I didn't like is that the steaming plate that comes with the cooker is  made of aluminum. But its not a deal breaker for me. I think that Presto is a very dependable brand and I'll happily recommend it to anyone.", "summary": "Aluminum to Stainless steel", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
