Clear pictures and instructions.  If you can learn from just looking at a page on a book with a few written details, it will teach you without expensive classes.

Keep it handy to look back at once in a while as a resource.", "summary": "very good very helpful", "product_name": "Wilton Decorating Cakes Book (The Wilton school)", "product_id": "0912696591"}
