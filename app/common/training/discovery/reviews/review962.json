I just now replaced it. I had used my old one for about 7 years and it was fine. No problems with my old one with the stainless steel either.I got this NEW one today, and washed it and peeled about 3-4 lbs potatoes and sliced 3/4 in thick, and added 2 cups water, two tbsp dried onion flakes, pepper, and garlic powder. 16 minutes later, drained the water off and used my handy dandy mixer and had the best creamiest fluffiest mashed potatoes ever. I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT ALONG WITHOUT IT THESE PAST FIVE YEARS!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO USE IT OFTEN!!THE BOTTOM LINE:Inexpensive,functions very well,looks nice,parts easy to order, (Walmart sells parts for it I heard)easy to clean,has two handles,AAA+++ for price and function.eta: I HAVE NOW HAD THIS PRESSURE COOKER FOR ALMOST 6 YEARS, IT IS STILL LIKE NEW, WORKS GREAT, NO PROBLEMS, I USE IT TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK. IT WAS AND STILL IS A GREAT COOKER. I COULD NOT GET ALONG WITHOUT IT.", "summary": "Great no frills pressure cooker!!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
