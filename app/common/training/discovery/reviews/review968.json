Presto has been making these things for a long time and it shows. This is the \"old-fashioned\" design with the rocker on top, but it's very quiet compared with older models and needs only a very modest heat to keep pressure up. The build quality seems great and the pressure interlock (that prevents the top being removed under pressure) is simple and works fine.In short, you can spend several times as much and not get much of value for the additional investment. Works perfectly, easy to clean, and replacement parts are widely available if needed. I wish Presto sold it in a kit with the glass cover and vegetable basket, but...it gets an easy five stars anyway. No regrets and I feel all warm and fuzzy over the money I saved.A note: This type of cooker does not have an instant pressure relief valve, so you'll have to run cold water over it if you need to release pressure quickly -- for instance, with some vegetables. Not a big deal IMO, but if it bothers you, you'll need to spend two or three times as much. I can't see the point.", "summary": "Just right!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
