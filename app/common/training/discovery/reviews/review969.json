I can't imagine how we (my wife and me) did all cooking before! It is soooo faster and easier with this pressure cooker. And the size is right for 2-3 people, I like fresh food and this one as I said is just right capacity for our family of 3. If you fill it at max, you even will have some food for next day, but because the whole cooking takes 15-20 minutes from very beginnings to the end it is no longer concern.Also found that I need to cook usually less time than it is in cookbook. Made in China, but quality is outstanding and overall construction is very sturdy and will last long. I feel it safe enought also, they are 3 different systems integrated so it will not blow in your hands. With no doubt, must have item for every house. I'll get 6-Quart Presto sometime soon to coock large quantities which I will pack using FoodSaver and store in the freezer. It definitely worth every penny and I can't believe it cost only $30.", "summary": "Great product", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
