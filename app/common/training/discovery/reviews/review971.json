As others have recently stated, it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws, making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady...no matter how many times I tighten the screws, and how tight I, or my husband, try to get them, they loosen and the handles become very wobbly. This is not just a problem with one handle, but both handles! I tried this item for a week, which required retightening the handles about a dozen times, and I have given up.Additionally, after only two washes, the screws are already starting to rust! I didn't wash it in the dishwasher, it was by hand.I can understand why this is an inexpensive product...it is cheaply made! However, I am baffled at why it gets such good reviews.", "summary": "HOW ON EARTH is this so well reviewed??", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
