I found that the 24 gallon size is plenty large enough for each of my intended uses, I kept my items limited to what was most basic and necessary and I still have room for some additional items.I am pleased that I got the 24 gallon size for my purposes because even when they are packed I can still lift them and they are easily transportable, I would think a larger size container that was packed may be too heavy to handle without help.I have posted some pictures, they have hard plastic handles that snap into position and they have a place for you to lock then. Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable.", "summary": "Sturdy Enough, Meets My Needs", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
