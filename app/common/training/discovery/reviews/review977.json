I also use the pot to boil water and have noticed that each time I do so, a few more rust spots form, so now the \"stainless steel\" pot is rusted completely inside.  I also use other stainless steel pots to boil water and they're all fine.Another problem is that the pop-up thing in the lid gets stuck often and I have to tap it to get it to pop up.  This issue is mentioned in the manual but that fact that it happens at all is a sign of poor design.The pot is made in China.  I recommend getting other similarly-priced but potentially better pots.As a followup (3/8/2006), I returned the pot to Presto and they were very surprised by the rust and said they'd never seen anything that bad so they're sending out another one.  I'll update this review with my experience with the new one.As a followup #2 (5/16/2006), I got a second pot from Presto and the same thing happened.  Rust all over the interior, just from boiling water.  I'm hoping to get my money back.Followup #3:  Presto engineers contacted me and asked for a sample of my tap water to test.  I sent them the sample but they never got back to me with the test results.  Customer service did refund my money though, so that was nice.  I suspect there might be something in our town's tap water that reacts with the pot.", "summary": "avoid this rusty pot!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
