Well, twenty some odd years later I finally purchased this one.  I read the instruction booklet and the first night made mashed potatoes and a pot roast.  Wow!  My 12 year old son loved the meal and said these mashed potatoes were the best he ever ate and the meat was so tender.  It was so easy to use and easy to clean.  I am already planning on making BBQ pork ribs next!  Whoo-Hoo! Buy it! Use it!....but read the instructions first! Enjoy:-)", "summary": "First time user.....and loved it.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
