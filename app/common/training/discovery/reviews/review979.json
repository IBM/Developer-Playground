Have always used foreign made cookers because years ago they were better quality than the American made cookers. Have a Magefesa and several Fagors and started having quality and service problems with them (see my review under Fagor's 6qt. Splendid model). Finally, in desperation, decided to try a new American made Presto since they were now made of Stainless steel and had good ratings with Amazon. Got one on sale from Amazon with free shipping and received it lickety-split in great shape (thanks Amazon). Read the user's guide which walked me through an easy assembly and proceeded to cook a pot of beans. Wow! Such simplicity and everything worked great. Straight forward simplicity and as well engineered as one could ever expect and as a bonus, much easier to clean. Can't see what could possibly go wrong. One more thing that I was highly impressed with is the users guide for the Presto; it is super clear and easy to understand with nothing left to chance. Kudos to current American products for a now great cooker. If you like pressure cookers, give the Presto a try!!!", "summary": "American Shines", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
