It's light and easy to maneuver.  I have two long hair cats and it has no problem with all of the shedding.  I like the carpet level adjustment so I can do the bare floor as well as the carpet (for thorough cleaning I use a small wand vacuum for the bare floors).  Assembly is a cinch, took me under 1/2 hour.  Returned my Oreck in favor of this one.", "summary": "Can't find anything wrong with it!!!!", "product_name": "Eureka Boss Upright Vacuum, 1934B - Corded", "product_id": "B00002N630"}
