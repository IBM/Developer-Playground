They are bulk generic, just like these, but I have had good luck with generic.  I have a bag type commercial model from Sams Club and I was told before buying it that it was notorious for breaking belts.  Belt breakage is a small price to pay for the way the vacuum works.  It was suggested by the carpet installer that did our house and he was right.  No dust, clean carpet.  I guess I drifted from reviewing the belts, but Walmart gets $3.50 for two belts and I got these for less than .50 apiece.  Here is the link.[...]Hate to do this to Amazon, but if you have a commercial bag type it will last years and you will save loads.  If they turn out to be no good I will edit my post.  Amazon is still the number one by far for my purchasing preference.  Most of the time you can't beat the price and you will never beat their service, never.  fredt", "summary": "Amazon isn't the best for the first time for me", "product_name": "Eureka Style RD Vacuum Belts", "product_id": "B00002N62X"}
