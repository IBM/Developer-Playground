This Presto cooker doubles nicely for both.  I already own an 8-quart electric pressure cooker but wanted something smaller for the smaller meals.  So far I have used it as a pressure cooker 2x, searing meat 1x, and sauteing unions 2x.  I'm glad I went this route instead of buying this Presto cooker and shelling out another $50-60 for another stainless steel sauce pan.", "summary": "Two for the price of one.", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
