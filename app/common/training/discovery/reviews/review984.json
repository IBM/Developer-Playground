It still runs, but the motor bearings are worn out. This one appeared almost identical to the original so I couldn't resist ordering it. The shape of the motor housing has been modernized a bit but most of the machine is identical, wheels, handle, belt, bag, etc. (Evidently Electrolux now owns Eureka as the ad says Electrolux, however, only the name Eureka appears on the machine, like the original!)Obviously, this is not the most powerful or sophisticated vacuum available, but it definitely has a place in the home. It has adequate power for routine cleaning. It is reasonably quiet, quite light, and is inexpensive. The combination of its adequate but not excessive vacuum and its good brush design makes it preferable to our bag-less machine for cleaning some of our more valuable rugs. (The bag-less is better on carpets.) In addition, it works well for use in our RV.", "summary": "A Very Useful Vacuum Cleaner", "product_name": "Eureka Boss Upright Vacuum, 1934B - Corded", "product_id": "B00002N630"}
