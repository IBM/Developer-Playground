They are a lovely pastel color, and come in a sealed plastic bag, so if the mailman hangs the package from the mailbox when it is raining, they will not get wet.  They were also folded nicely.  I have Prime, and when I first bought them, I was not given the option of buying  nine, so I had to wait to buy something else to be able to get them.  I was not really happy about this, but I expected that Amazon would have them cheaper than I could buy locally at the &#34;big box&#34; stores.  I am a daily vacuumer, and bought a Dyson from Amazon, but it lost its suction in seven months, and luckily I had saved my two Hoovers... a convertible and a concept two (which I think is from the 80's, and still is wonderful) so I use a lot of bags.  I would much rather throw a bag away than have to empty that cylinder every day.  Well, since I found that I can buy them locally for the same price, or the Arm and H..... ones for half that price, I won't be buying them any more from Amazon, but I still really like the vacuum bags, and they have proven their worth.  Hopefully I have covered the subject well enough for Amazon.", "summary": "What else can one say about Vac Bags?", "product_name": "Hoover 4010001A Type A Vacuum Bags, 3 Bags", "product_id": "B00002N636"}
