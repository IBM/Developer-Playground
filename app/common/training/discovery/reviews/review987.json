But, anyways I am. Some of the most common problems that people face with pressure cookers are: loud sound, too many whistles and food that sticks to the bottom never comes off while cleaning. This cooker is a pleasant surprise, because none of these problems happen with this Presto. I simply dumped lentils, carrots, peas and pearl onions altogether into this cooker and boom, after 30 minutes, the lentils soup was ready. Now, you may think what is so special about this. Well, here is the interesting part. Generally, when lentils are cooked in pressure cookers, they appear like separate lentil seeds cooked individually and do not gel with the vegetables together to form into a running soup. But, after cooking in this Presto cooker, the whole thing turned out to be a perfect soup, even without me putting any extra effort to mix the vegetables with a spatula. It blended the lentils and vegetables in such a beautiful way that it was just ready to eat. Now, here is the good part, it did not make annoying whistles, it did not pour even a single drop of water or soup out of the top and the inner side of the lid is immaculate even after cooking three cups of lentils. So, that means, nothing was spilling during the cooking process. It is the most controlled and well-designed cooker I have ever used in my whole life. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Whenever, you cook in this cooker, it will make you feel like something healthy is in store for you to eat and also gets you excited to eat it hot from the stove and of course contributes to a much more healthy lifestyle.", "summary": "This stainless is absolutely strain less and fantastic !!!", "product_name": "Presto 01341 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker", "product_id": "B00002N602"}
