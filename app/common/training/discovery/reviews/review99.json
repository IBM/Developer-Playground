It is easy to use & works very well. I like the auto turn off so you dont run your battery out. The only drawback is that the buttons are very small. I would love to have the same product with bigger buttons. I would defiantly recommend this product.", "summary": "spell check", "product_name": "Franklin SPELLING CORRECTOR", "product_id": "1567120709"}
