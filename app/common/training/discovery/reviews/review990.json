This was perfect!It clamps down well, is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise, its a small, durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?", "summary": "Perfect for gear", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
