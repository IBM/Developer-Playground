BUT now that I have a TODDLER, these really can't be used anymore, since she finds it fun to pull out the little plastic pieces that are needed to set the timer. Not only is this a choking hazard (however minor), but once the pieces are gone, the timer is useless! CAUTION WITH DIGITAL TIMERS, TOO, THOUGH (though I'll have to try them again): We had a power surge, and all of the timers got ruined (and we tried to change the batteries - no help)! SO, OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT AND MORE RELIABLE THAN DIGITAL TIMERS, but NOT good if you have toddlers!", "summary": "WORKS GREAT, BUT DON'T GET IF YOU HAVE YOUNG KIDS...", "product_name": "Intermatic TN311C 120 Volt Heavy Duty Grounded Timer", "product_id": "B00002N5FO"}
