Using Super Saver Free Shipping!It wasn't due until as late as Jan 16th, but there it was.And it is WONDERFUL!  The FLOOR I COULD NOT GET CLEAN WAS CLEAN! ...within minutes of completing the very easy assembly!This floor is one of those old linoleum floors with tiny grooves as part of the design...supposed to look like mediterranean tile.I don't plan to use it for rugs... I'll get myself another Hoover rug steamer with 5 circulating scrubbing disks for that!  But for cleaning the rest of my floors, the Hoover F4300 Floormax Supreme is my baby!Not only did it clean like a whiz....but it was so easy and smooth to direct it was almost like using a magic wand to scrub the floor!  It got right up next to the wall and pulled out hair and yuck...without splashing the wall!  It was amazing!I had one of these many years ago, but this one is even better!  It's far easier to handle and way quieter.My only regret is not ordering it a long time ago!Thank you Hoover and Amazon!", "summary": "Hoover F4300 Floormax Supreme - Wonderful!", "product_name": "Hoover F4300 Floormax Supreme", "product_id": "B00002N63A"}
