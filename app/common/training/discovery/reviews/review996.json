I carry them in the back of my pickup truck when I need tools and toss them in the garage when I don't need them.  It makes it easy to load my truck in a hurry.What I like about them.1.  They will stack with the lid on.2.  They nest inside each other when empty3.  Lid is fairly sturdy--you can sit on one if you are careful.4.  Having a bunch of them, means they all are the same height if you want to build a platform.5.  With the lid on they are waterproof.6.  Locking handles have a solid secure feel to them.7.  With only one handle locked it act like a hinge--you can open it from one side.8.  You can write on the lids with a Sharpie pen.9.  Good size for lifting and carrying.  I've had something similar but larger and found it was too hard to lift when loaded.  These are a good size.What I didn't like.1.  One had a damaged handle.  I was going to return it, but they were out.  I can repair it with a drill and a cotter pin--so I decided to keep it anyway.2.  Hard to find more locally.I'd buy more of these if I could find them.  I use them to sort tools and activities by type.  For example, I use one for power tools, one for fiberglass materials, one for general tools.  I'd like one for camping gear.I'd give it five stars except for the one defective one I purchased.  Functionally they are excellent.  I'd recommend buying them locally and carefully inspecting them to be sure you have ones that are defect free.", "summary": "Decent Cheap, Stackable storage containers", "product_name": "Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon", "product_id": "B00002N6SQ"}
