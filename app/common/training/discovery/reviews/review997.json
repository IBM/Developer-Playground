I'm cleaning a house to put on the market and this little machine has already saved countless hours. The entire lower level is tile and the upper level is carpet with a linoleum floored kitchen. I got the tile cleaned in no time with this machine, it did a beautiful job cleaning and restoring the tile to like new condition. I have started cleaning the carpet and am very pleased with the results. The brushes are powering out stains/dirt that the steam cleaner wasn't getting, and the brushes have raised the carpet pile in high traffic areas that were matted down. After using the Floormax, I extract the excess fluid from the carpet with a steam cleaner and then steam rinse with clean hot water; the results are amazing. The carpet brushes get right up to the baseboard so there are no dirty carpet edges. I also cleaned the old linoleum in the kitchen and was surprised how beautiful this old floor actually is. The Floormax removed all of the old dirt and stains, a coat of Future made it look brand new.I highly recommend this product - it's easy to assemble, a time saver...and a knee and back saver too! The only drawback is the excess fluid it leaves behind to be wiped up.", "summary": "A Great Cleaning Product!", "product_name": "Hoover F4300 Floormax Supreme", "product_id": "B00002N63A"}
