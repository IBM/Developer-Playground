I have used protractors before but had to always eyeball the markings with various degrees of accuracy.  This protractor takes away that error.  A bonus is that a .5mm mechanical pencil came in the package too.  It is just the right diameter to fit in all of the holes and slots.The T-bar is a good feature also.  You can loosen the thumb screws to slide the T-bar off of the protractor.  Be careful to not loosen the thumb screw all of the way since they are tightened by two nuts in the T-bar channel which will come off of the threads if the thumb screws are loosened too much.  Once the T-bar is removed you can then remove the nuts from the thumb screws so the thumb screws can be removed from the protractor in order to lay the protractor flat.  To re-attach the T-bar to the protractor insert the threaded shaft on the thumb screws in the large holes on the protractor, thread the nuts on enough to secure them, the slide the nuts into the T-bar channel and tighten down the thumb screw.  There is an indexing  lip on one side of the T-bar that the base of the protractor rests up against to ensure accuracy.The T-bar is 7 in. (178 mm) long by 11/16 in. (17 mm) wide by 7/16 in. (11mm) thick.", "summary": "Great instrument with bonus .5mm pencil", "product_name": "Incra PROTRAC06 6-Inch Precision Marking Protractor", "product_id": "B00002255K"}
