Being silent is important to me because it's annoying to hear buzzing especially if you are using it in a quiet room.In my case, I use it on my refrigerator so that I don't hear the fridge on when I'm watching a movie on my HDTV in the living room (which is in close proximity to the kitchen).I don't use any red 'off' pins on the timer and just use the manual switch to turn off the fridge before I start watching a movie. Then I turn the dial so that the green pin is about 2 hours away, which nicely turns the refrigerator back on two hours later.This setup works very well for me and my food doesn't suffer any. Before I got this timer, I used to turn off the circuit breaker for the refrigerator but I would forget to turn it back on! Needless to say, this timer has been a life saver in that my fridge comes back on and my food doesn't spoil like it did when I forgot to turn it on manually.The fact that this timer has a 3 prong plug is also a plus because many of the non 'heavy duty' timers only have a 2 prong plug.", "summary": "Best timer I've found yet", "product_name": "Intermatic TN311C 120 Volt Heavy Duty Grounded Timer", "product_id": "B00002N5FO"}
